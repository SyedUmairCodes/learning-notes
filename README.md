# Learning notes

These are all of my notes that I took during the online courses that I enrolled in and the books that I have read. 

I'm currently experimenting with how should I upload my finished notes. Most will be the same but some will be more simplified and instead of markdown I'll upload a finished PDF file so that it will be easier to read.

I'm also experimenting with trying to use both  [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)  and [Obsidian MD](https://obsidian.md/) but the old version of the notes can be accessed from the old commits.
