# For-of loop
The for-of loop is a new loop introduced in JavaScript. It is not supoorted in Internet explorer and works well in other modern browsers. The for-of loop has a clean syntax and is used for iterating over arrays and strings. 

```js
    let fruitsBasket =["apple","banana","orange","mango","pineapple"]
    
    for(let fruit of fruitsBasket){
        console.log(fruit);
    }
```

The for-of loop is a great way to iterate over arrays or objects but if you need to iterate over an array while also keeping in mind the index of the values then the regular for loop is what you require.
