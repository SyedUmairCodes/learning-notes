# Prototypes
According to the MDN docs:
>  Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from on another.

Each object can have a prototype which acts as a template. Certain objects like arrays don't have mehods like `pop` or `push`. These methods are stored in the `__proto__` property that references all the methods from the arrays prototype.
