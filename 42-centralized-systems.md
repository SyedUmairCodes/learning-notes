# Centralized systems
Centralized systems are conventional (client-server) IT systems in which there is a single authority that controls the system, and who is solely in charge of all operations on the system. 

All users of a centralized system are dependent on a single source of service. The majority of online service providers, including Google, Amazon, eBay, and Apple's App Store, use this conventional model to deliver services.
