# Regulations and Inflation
Currencies are inflatable. Meaning, the more money the government prints out the more existing money loses it's value. The government can increase and decrease the value of their currencies according to their needs.

Crypto currencies are some what free from inflation because they aren't controlled by a single entity that can increase and decrease their value. In-fact some crypto currencies are designed to increase their value by decreasing the amount of the total currency that can be mined.
