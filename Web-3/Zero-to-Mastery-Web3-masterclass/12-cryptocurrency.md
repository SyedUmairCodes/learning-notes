# Cryptocurrency

Crypto currencies are digital currency that any person in the world can use. Normal currency like dollars and yen require a central governing body that regulates these currencies. The governing body applies rules and regulations to these currencies which everyone has to follow. 

Since these currencies are printed on paper and coins they can't be transfered digitally unless you use a third-party service which also takes a minimal service fee for transfering your money. Crypto currencies on the other don't have any central governing body instead they rely on the rules of the block-chain they are used on. Crypto currencies don't exist on paper they are all digital and that's why we don't need a third-party service to send and recieve them.

Just like normal currency, there are many types of crypto currencies available today that have a total market cap of more than that of a country's GDP. The two most popular crypto currencies are bitcoin and Ethereum and most other crypto currencies are just copies of these two with more or less features.
