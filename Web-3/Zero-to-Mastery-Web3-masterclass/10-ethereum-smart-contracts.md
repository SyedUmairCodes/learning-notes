# Ethereum and smart contracts
All accounts on the Ethereum block-chain have the ability to send, receive and hold ether.

There are two types of accounts you can create on the Ethereum block-chain, One being an externally owned account and the second one being an contract account.

Externally owned accounts can only interact with the account balance that is available in the account. Contract accounts can access all of the properties of the account including balance, storage and the code stored in the account.

Contract accounts can access the account without human intervention and sometimes are called smart contracts.

Interacting with a smart contract can be done in two ways. The first being contract creation and the second being message calls.

You can create and upload smart contracts on the Ethereum global state and once the contract is saved you can make message calls on the contract.

Message calls allows you to access the smart contracts and execute the code stored in them.

Smart contracts can do almost anything that you can program them to do. Some people can also add malicious code in the smart contract but there is a way built into the Ethereum block-chain that mitigates the risk of such a thing happening. 

We talked about gas before. If a malicious person were to execute bad code it would require him to pay a high amount of gas fees and only then can the malicious code be executed.
