# Ethereum virtual machine
The Ethereum virtual machine is what makes our smart contracts run on the Ethereum network. The computer on the Ethereum network act as a distributed computer for the Ethereum virtual machine to run our smart contracts and also validating new blocks to add them to the block-chain.

The Ethereum client software allows any general purpose computer to be a node on the Ethereum network. As a node your computer can communicate with all the other computers that are available on the Ethereum network

There are many Ethereum clients available but the most popular one is called **GO Ethereum** which is based on the Go programming language created by google.

When you install a client you'll also have access to the Ethereum virtual machine or EVM for short.  You can test your smart contracts on your own computer once you have the client installed.
