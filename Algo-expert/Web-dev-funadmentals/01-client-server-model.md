# Client-server model
The client server model is the most commonly used architecture in developing desktop, mobile, and web applications.

The computer that requests information from another computer is called a client and the computer that sends that data is called the server.

The client can be anything. It could be your mobile phone, computer,  or even your smart-home device. While the server can be an API server or a database server that is used to retrieve data and show it to you.

Sometimes, there are more than two computers that are talking to each other. There can exist a scenario in which you have a client, a server, and a separate database server.

In a scenario like this the client first requests data from the server than the server sees which data is the client requesting, It then retrieves that data from the database server and sends it back to the client.
