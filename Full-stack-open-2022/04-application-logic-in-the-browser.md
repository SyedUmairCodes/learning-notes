# Running application logic in the browser
Clear the developer console in your browser by typing "clear()" and then click on the "notes" link on the web page.

Clicking on the notes link will take you to the page where all of the notes are stored. Take a look at the network tab, this time there will be four events that happened when the browser communicated with the server.

All four of these events are of different types. The first one is an HTML document, the second one is a style sheet used for styling our web page, the third is a JavaScript file that handles all of our logic, and the final event is a JSON file that contains all of the notes in "raw" format.
