# AJAX
The Notes page of the application follows an early-nineties style of web development and "uses Ajax". As such, it's on the crest of the wave of early 2000's web technology.

[AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a term introduced in February 2005 on the back of advancements in browser technology to describe a new revolutionary approach that enabled the fetching of content to web pages using JavaScript included within the HTML, without the need to rerender the page.

Prior to the AJAX era, all web pages worked like the [traditional web application](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#traditional-web-applications) we saw earlier in this chapter. All of the data shown on the page was fetched with the HTML-code generated by the server.

The Notes page uses AJAX to fetch the notes data. Submitting the form still uses the traditional mechanism of submitting web-forms.

Nowadays URLs like these would not be considered acceptable, as they don't follow the generally acknowledged conventions of [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_Web_services) APIs, which we'll look into more in [part 3](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)
The thing termed AJAX is now so commonplace that it's taken for granted. The term has faded into oblivion, and the new generation has not even heard of it.
