# Single page apps
The example application looks and works like a traditional web application. All of the logic is on the server, and the browser only renders the HTML as instructed.

In recent years, the [Single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) style of creating web-applications has emerged. SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately from the server like our sample application does, but instead comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, the contents of which are manipulated with JavaScript that executes in the browser.

The notes page of our application bears some resemblance to a SPA but not quite. The single-page-application version of our example is also available.
