# HTTP GET
The server and the browser communicate with each other using the [HTTP ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) protocol. You will see that when you reload the web page (press the  f5 key) the network tab in the browser console will show two items: one will be the data received from the server and the second will be the image.

Clicking on the first event in the network tab will reveal more information about what's happening. The *general* tab shows that the browser made a request to the server using the GET method and the response was successful. It show's a status code of 200 to verify that the request was successful.
