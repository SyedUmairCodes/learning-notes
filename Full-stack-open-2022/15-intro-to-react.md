# Introduction to react
React is the most popular JavaScript library for front-end development because it offers great features, a component based approach and great community.

The easiest way to start using react is a tool created by the react developers called *create-react-app*. To use this tool you should have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

```js
npm create-react-app demo-app 
/*This command will create a new react app called 
demo */
```

Open the app folder and run the start command to start the application in your browser it will launch at the port *localhost:3000* on your computer. Always remember the [[01.First rule of web development]] when developing any type of web application.
