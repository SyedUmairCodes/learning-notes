# Traditional web application
The example application is a traditional web application. When you first load the page the browser fetches the HTML code and then downloads the image and displays it where it was placed in the HTML file. 

In a traditional web application the browser is considered "dumb" and is used only for displaying data. All of the logic of the application is handled by the server. (We will use Node.js and express.js which are based on JavaScript to create servers. )
