# CSS
Cascading style sheets or CSS for short is the language that helps us to decorate our web pages and add styling to them. The amount of styling and complex animations and effects that you can create with CSS is infinite.

CSS works using selectors(Classes and Ids) which select which element in the DOM needs to be styled.

Again, You can use the element tab in the console to play around with your styling and then save them to your CSS files.
