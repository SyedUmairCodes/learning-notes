# Document Object Model
HTML documents are organized in a tree like structure. Starting from the "<!doctype html/>" tag all the way down to the closing body tag.

Since, HTML code is structured like a tree the Document Object Model or DOM is an application programming interface (API) that enables programmatic modification of the *Element tree* corresponding to web pages.

## Manipulating the DOM from the console
The top of the DOM tree starts from the document object in an HTML file. There are various things that we can perform on the DOM from the console. You can even use the console to add a new note to the notes page only by interacting with the DOM. 

The changes that you make in the application from the DOM will not be saved and will be removed once the page reloads. Because the notes are coming from the JSON file and the server.
