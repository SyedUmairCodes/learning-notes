# Components
Every thing in react is a component. All of the files that are needed to be rendered in the browser are defined and exported as components in react.

A component can have smaller components inside it and render all of them. 

## JSX
At first glance, react components look like HTML markup with some JavaScript in them. However, this is not the case. The layout of React components is mostly written using [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) . Although JSX looks like HTML, we are actually dealing with a way to write JavaScript. Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript

The compiling is done by Babel and you can actually create react components without using JSX but it's not recommended. JSX is like HTML and JS had a baby together.
