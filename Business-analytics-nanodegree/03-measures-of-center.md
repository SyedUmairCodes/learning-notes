# Measures of center
When working with continuous and discrete data there are four things that you need to keep track of. Center, spread, shape, and outliers. The measures of center are divided into three types. Mean, median, and mode.

## Mean
The mean value is calculated by adding all of the values and dividing 
them by the number of total values that we have.

## Median
The median splits the data into two different sets such that 50% of the data is higher than the other. If there are even numbers of data points in the data set such as nine then the median will be the median will be the fifth value. For odd data points such as seven, the fourth value will be considered the median.

## Mode
The mode is used to find the most frequent or average value in a data set. There can be more than one mode in a data set.
