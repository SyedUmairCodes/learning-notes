# JavaScript runtime environment
Node is a JavaScript runtime, it's not a language, or a framework.  A runtime environment allows use to use JavaScript.

Node is based on the V8 JavaScript engine created by Google and every time that Google makes improvements to the V8 engine those improvements are also added to Node which makes it more faster and efficient.

Node allows you to do more than just run JavaScript code. It allows you to read and write files, access databases, and do much more things. It does that by using a library called *libuv*.  libuv is multi-platform C library that allows Node to perform asynchronous I/O based on event loops.

Node uses both the V8 engine and the libuv library to handle server-side JavaScript code and much more.
