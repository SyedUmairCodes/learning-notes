# Node Vs JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language, You write JavaScript codes and send them to a web browser which uses it's JavaScript engine to render your code and output the result.

Node is a way of running JavaScript code outside of the web browser  like on a  server. Node was made because the JavaScript engine used by Google Chrome was open-sourced and a developer named Rhyan Dhal took advantage of this and made Node. Node allows JavaScript to be used anywhere that you want to.

JavaScript in the browser uses the window object to manipulate objects on the dom while Node uses the global object but it doesn't have browser specific built-in methods like the window object does.
