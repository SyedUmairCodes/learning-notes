# Node is born
JavaScript can only be run in a web browser, programmers write JavaScript code and then send it to a we browser where the JavaScript engine runs our code for us.

The web-browser that you use comes with a JavaScript engine built-in to it that runs our code inside the web browser. 

If the web browser doesn't come with a JavaScript engine or the engine is outdated your code might not work, There are multiple JavaScript engines that can read our code. The most popular one is called V8 which is the JavaScript engine used in the Google Chrome web browser and other chromium based web browsers, Firefox and Safari use the SpiderMonkey and JavaScriptCore engines respectively.

A JavaScript engine is only present in a web browser, if you to run your JavaScript code outside of the web browser you're going to need a runtime environment for JavaScript which allows JavaScript to be run outside a web browser.

Node is a runtime environment which uses the V8 engine from the Google Chrome web browser that allows us to use JavaScript in the server and create backend APIs and desktop applications.
