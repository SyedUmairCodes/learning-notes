# Calm the fuck down

What if X happens?
What if Y goes wrong?
What if Z doesn’t turn out like I want/need/expect it to?
The “X” you’re worried about could be anything from getting your period on a first date to the untimely death of a loved one. “Y” could be your dissertation defense or the landing gear on your connecting flight to Milwaukee. “Z” might be a job interview, a driving test, or the rather large wager you placed on the latest Royal baby name. (It’s a four-thousand-pound shame they didn’t go with Gary, I know.)
In the end, it doesn’t matter precisely what your what-ifs are—only that they exist and they’re occupying some/a lot/too much of your mental space on any given day, unraveling your metaphorical sweater bit by bit. You would therefore do well to note the following:
Lesson #4: A bunch of this shit is unlikely to happen at all.
Lesson #5: You can prevent some of it and mitigate the effects of some of the rest.
Lesson #6: Some of it is and has always been completely out of your hands and locked in the steely grip of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. You need to take your

And hey, no judgments. I’m right there with you (hence the hard-won qualifications to have written this book).
For most of my life, I’ve been a champion worrier. What-ifs swirl inside my skull like minnows on a meth bender. I fret about shit that hasn’t happened. I obsess over shit that may or may not happen. And when shit does happen, I possess an astounding capacity for freaking out about it.
But over the last few years I’ve found ways to keep that stuff to a minimum. I’m not completely worry-free, but I have become less anxious and am no longer, shall we say, paralyzed by dread and/or driven to the brink of madness by unmet expectations and a boiling sense of injustice. It’s an improvement.
I’m amazed at how good it feels and how much I’ve been able to accomplish with a relatively simple change in mind-set—accepting the shit I can’t control—which allows me to focus on dealing with the shit I can control, leaving me better equipped to make decisions and solve problems both in the moment and after the fact.
And even to prevent some of them from happening in the first place. Nifty!
I’ve learned how to stop dwelling on unlikely outcomes in favor of acting to create more likely ones. How to plow forward rather than agonize backward. And crucially, how to separate my anxiety about what might occur from the act of handling it when it does occur.
You can learn to do all of that too. Calm the Fuck Down will help you—
Stop freaking out about shit you can’t control.
AND
Enable yourself to make rational decisions.
SO YOU CAN
Solve problems instead of making them worse.
Here’s what that process looked like for me during the last few years, and a little taste of how it can work for you.

You just need to shift your mind-set, like I did, to react to problems in a different way. In doing so, you’ll also learn that you actually can prepare for the unexpected, which helps a lot with that whole “one step back” thing.
How is that possible? Wouldn’t preparing for every potential outcome drive you crazy in a totally different way?
Well yes, yes it would. But I’m not talking about securing multiple locations for your husband’s thirtieth-birthday party because “what if” it rains; or preparing three different versions of a presentation because “what if” the client seems to be in less of a pie chart and more of a bar graph mood that day; or erecting a complicated system of moats around your property because “what if” your neighbor’s frisky cows get loose someday. That could definitely drive you crazy in a different way. And possibly to bankruptcy.
I’m talking about preparing mentally.
That’s what this book helps you do, so that when shit happens, you’ll have the tools to handle it—whoever you are, wherever you live, and whenever things get hairy.
(Pssst: that’s what we in the biz call “foreshadowing.”)
A few months ago after a pleasant night out at a local tiki bar, my husband and I arrived home to an unexpected visitor.
I had opened our gate and was slowly picking my way across the flagstone path to our deck (it was dark, I was tipsy) when a larger-than-usual leaf caught my eye. It seemed to be not so much fluttering on the breeze as… scuttling on it. A quick beam of my iPhone flashlight confirmed that the presumptive almond leaf was in fact a tarantula the size of a honeydew melon.
Yup. I’ll give you a moment to recover. Lord knows I needed one.
Now, assuming you haven’t thrown the book across the room in disgust (or that you have at least picked it back up), may I continue?
Having previously declared my intention to BURN THE MOTHERFUCKER DOWN if we ever spotted such a creature in our house, I was faced with a quandary. By this time, I had grown fond of my house. And technically, the creature was not in it. Just near it.
What to do? Stand frozen in place until the thing wandered back to the unknowable depths from whence it came? Sleep with one eye open for eternity? Politely ask the tarantula to skedaddle?

ACKNOWLEDGE what has happened (a tarantula is in my house)
ACCEPT what you can’t control (tarantulas can get into my house?!?)
ADDRESS what you can control (get the tarantula out of my house)
I had officially calmed the fuck down—now it was time to deal with it.
Fine, it was time for my husband to deal with it. I helped.
Using an empty plastic pitcher, a broom, a piece of cardboard, and nerves of steel, he trapped the thing humanely and secured it on the dining table while I rounded up sunscreen, towels, portable speakers, and an extra pint of Barceló because last time the boat captain underestimated and really, who wants to hang out on a deserted beach with an infinite supply of coconuts and a finite supply of rum? YOU CAN CONTROL THE RUM.
Then we drove a mile down the road with our new pal Lucky (ensconced in his plastic jug), released the wayward spider into a vacant lot, and boarded the SS Mama Needs Her Juice.
