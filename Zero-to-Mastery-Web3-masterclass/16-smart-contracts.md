# Why smart contracts
Block-chain technology has a lot of applications other than just money and transactions.

Bitcoin can be only be used to send and receive money, But Ethereum is another block-chain that allows you to send and receive money as well as store anything on the block-chain including code. The code stored in the Ethereum block-chain is stored inside a smart-contract.

A smart contract is a piece of code that lives on the Ethereum block-chain and is used to trigger certain events when the required condition is met.
