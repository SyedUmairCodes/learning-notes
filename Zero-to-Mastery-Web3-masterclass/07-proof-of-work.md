# Proof of work
Bitcoin introduced an algorithm known as **proof of work** to conduct the consensus on the block-chain. This is not a simple task because there are so many people on the block-chain and each person has his own copy of the block-chain.

Proof of work allows the person that wants to update the transactions on the block-chain, he must show his proof of work. When the computer adds blocks on the block-chain it does that by mining more bitcoin.

Proof of work requires you to use your computer to keep guessing the correct hash of the next block on the block-chain and this can become very tedious because every miner is also doing the same thing with their own computers. In the end this becomes a race to see who guesses the most correct hashes and mines the most bitcoin.

The whole bitcoin network mines new blocks at the same time and this consumes a lot of energy. The estimated power usage of just the bitcoin networ2k is estimated around 15 giga watts of power per every 24 hours.

The insane amount of power required to operate a bitcoin mining network and the effect of this on the environment is the main con of block-chain networks. 

Each block only needs a single three-digit hash in the bitcoin block-chain but there are so many people mining these hashes that for every single correct hash there are more than a billion rejected hashes that are wasted.
