# Block-chain for health care
Block-chain technology can be a great asset in the world of health care. We can de-centralize the health records of patients that are admitted in an hospital or all of the hospitals in the country. This allows your records to be available to every doctor that you visit and then the doctor can help you more effectively because he'll have an understanding of your previous health conditions.

A person also has privacy and regulations regarding his health records and should be encrypted and only be accessible to you and your doctor and also the doctor that *You* allow to see them.
