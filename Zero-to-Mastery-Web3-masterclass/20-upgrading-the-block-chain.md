# Forking and upgrading the block-chain
A block-chain is a database of transactions that is distributed to every single person that makes a transaction and since every person has his own copy a consensus is used to make sure that all members have the exact same data.

If someone wanted to take the current state of the block-chain and add or remove features from it and transform into his own version he needs to create a fork of the block-chain.

There are two types of forks a person can make, A soft fork or a hard fork. A soft fork is an upgrade is backwards compatible. Meaning that the older version of the block-chain can recognize the new update and the newer version can work seamlessly with the old one. Sometimes the developers will focus on only the new version and only offer limited support for the old version and will request users to migrate to the newer version

A hard fork is an upgrade that introduces completely new changes that are backwards compatible and the only option to keep using the software is to upgrade to the newer version because the changes are so different that they cannot be compatible with the older version.
