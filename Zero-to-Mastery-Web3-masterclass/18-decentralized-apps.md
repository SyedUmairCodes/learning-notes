# Decentralized applications
Decentralized applications or DApps for short are the programs and code that you write which is executed on the block-chain. We can say that a smart-contract is basically a DApp.

When you create a front-end user interface for any of your smart contracts its then called a DApp. The user-interface is created using web technologies like HTML, CSS. and JavaScript while the logic of the DApp is hosted on the block-chain network.

Web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to read and write data to the Ethereum block-chain using JavaScript. You don't necessarily need to use JavaScript. You can use any programming language to create front-ends for your DApps.

There are also different types of block-chains that you can host your DApps on like Ethereum and Solana. In Ethereum the more complex transaction that is performed by your DApp the more gas fees you'll have to pay for it.
