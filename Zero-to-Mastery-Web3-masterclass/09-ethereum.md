# Ethereum
Ethereum is the worlds first programmable block-chain. Bitcoin is only capable of performing transactions and nothing more.

Ethereum is another block-chain that takes the same approach as bitcoin but allows the its crypto currency called ether to be programmable.

A block in the Ethereum block-chain can store more data than a block in the bitcoin block-chain which makes it able store more data than just transactions.

This allows people to make games and apps on the Ethereum block-chain. This code can be executed when a transaction is performed on the block in which the code is present.

All of these advanced transactions on the Ethereum block-chain is not free. All of the transactions performed on the Ethereum block-chain a small amount called gas has to be paid in order to complete the transaction.

Gas, is the fees you'll pay to interact with the Ethereum block-chain.
