# Everything is fucked
- **Author:** Mark Mason
- **Genre:** Self-help, Philosophy

# Emotional gravity
- There is an emotional gravity to our values, we attract those into our orbit who value the same things we do, and instinctively repel, as if by reverse magnetism, those whose values are contrary to our own.
- Large swaths of people coalesce together, forming tribes and communities based on the similar evaluations of their emotional histories.  
- You and I can like one thing and keep talking about it all day long and create a strong freindship.
