# Build and maintain hope
- To build and maintain hope, we need three things: a sense of control, a belief in the value of something, and a community.
- Control means we feel as though we’re in control of our own life, that we can affect our fate.
- Values means we find something important enough to work toward, something better, that’s worth striving for. 
- Community means we are part of a group that values the same things we do and is working toward achieving those things. Without a community, we feel isolated, and our values cease to mean anything.
- Without values, nothing appears worth pursuing. And without control, we feel powerless to pursue anything. Lose any of the three, and you lose the other two. Lose any of the three, and you lose hope.
