# Emotional problems
- Every problem of self-control is not a problem of information or discipline or reason but, rather, of emotion.
- Self-control is an emotional problem; laziness is an emotional problem; procrastination is an emotional problem; underachievement is an emotional problem; impulsiveness is an emotional problem.
