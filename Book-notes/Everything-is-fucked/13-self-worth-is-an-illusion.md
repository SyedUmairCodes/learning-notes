# Self-worth is an illusion

According to Newton’s Second Law of Emotion:
>How we come to value everything in life relative to ourselves is the sum of our emotions over time.  
  
Self-worth is an illusion It’s a psychological construct that our Feeling Brain spins in order to predict what will help it and what will hurt it. Ultimately, we must feel something about ourselves in order to feel something about the world, and without those feelings, it’s impossible for us to find hope.
