# Moral gaps
If someone hurts you, you think that this person is a piece of trash and you start hating him and want to hurt them even more. This is called a moral gap, the sense that one of us is inherently righteous, and the other is an inferior piece of shit.

When confronted with moral gaps, we develop overwhelming emotions toward equalization, or a return to moral equality. These desires for equalization take the form of a sense of deserving.

If I apologize to you and somehow cover for the damage that I've dealt you'll feel like we are now equal because the moral gap between us is now equal and neither of us deserves better or worse treatment than the other any longer. We’re operating on the same moral plane. 

But, if I buy you nice things, do your work for you, and keep giving you compliements will also create a moral gap between us. You will feel indebted to me, that you “owe me” something, that I deserve something good or that you need to “make it up” to me somehow. You will have.

When moral gaps persist for a long enough time, they normalize. They become our default expectation. They lodge themselves into our value hierarchy.
