# Line Height
Giving your text a line height of 1.5 is a good idea but this does not apply to all scenarios and is not a constant value.

Line height is added to text to make it more readable and makes it easier for the reader to find where the text wraps.

When lines of text are spaced too tightly, it’s easy to finish reading a line of text at the right edge of a page then jump your eyes all the way back to the left edge only to be unsure which line is next.

choosing the right line length and font-size is also a factor to make the text more easy to read.  Line-height and font size are inversely proportional — use a taller line-height for small text and a shorter line-height for large text.
