# White space
One of the easiest methods of desging a good UI is that you use all the white/negative space that is available and let your UI breath. Give your elements more white space than they require and then keep removing it untill your design looks perfect, don't try this the other way.

There are also some types of UIs like a dashboard that require you to show as much data as possible and you will have to remove almost all of the unnecssary white space and make your UI dense.
