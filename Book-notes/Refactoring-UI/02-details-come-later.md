# Details come later
- In the beginning of a new design don't stress over the color schemes and fonts. You can change these things later on. Focus on the main layout of the component you're designing, where do the text fields go, where should the call-to-action button be placed. These are the things that you should focus on when starting a new design. 
- Create your initial designs in gray-scale and don't introduce color to the design until it is finalized. This will allow you to experiment with spacing, contrast and size of the design and you'll end up with a cleaner design that you can add color to whenever you want.
- Focus only on the initial design first then you can add the final touches or animations whenever you want.
