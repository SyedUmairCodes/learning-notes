# Letter spacing
A lot of effort is put into getting the weight, color, and line height of the text just right, but letter-spacing is also a great underated tweak to make your text look perfect.

As a general rule, you should trust the typeface designer and leave letter-spacing alone. But there are also situations where you just have to take matters into your own hands.

You can make the titles or headlines more compact by adding more weight to them to add a condensed look. Avoid trying to make this work the other way around though â€” headline fonts rarely work well at small sizes even if you increase the letter spacing.

If you're using all-caps in your headings or titles letter-spacing plays a important part to make it look nice.
