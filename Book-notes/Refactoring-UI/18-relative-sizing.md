# Relative sizing doesn't scale
Not every part of an interface should be sized relative to one another, and that if element A needs to shrink by 25% on smaller screens, that element B should shrink by 25%, too.

The idea that things should scale independently doesnâ€™t just apply to sizing elements at different screen sizes; it applies to the properties of a single component, too.

Let go of the idea that everything needs to scale proportionately giving yourself the freedom to fine-tune things independently makes it a hell of a lot easier to design for multiple contexts.
