# Don't use grey text everywhere
- If your background is white using a light grey shade will make it look nice but on colored backgrounds this will not work. Instead what you can do is choose a color that is closer to the background color.
- Using grey text on a background that is an image or has a pattern is also not recommended because if the text is to transparent it will make the pattern see through and this will effect users in reading the text.
