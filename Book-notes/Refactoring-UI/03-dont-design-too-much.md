# Refactoring UI
- **Author:** Steve Schoger, Adam Wathan
- **Genre:** Design

# Don't design too much
- Figuring out every single edge case that can happen while the end-user is using your app is just not possible and you shouldn't try to solve them all. 
- You don't have to implement every single feature that your app is capable of in the beginning. Only design the essential features and then keep designing other features one by one and improving on the ones that are already built. 
- Don't design functions that you won't be able to implement in your app. Even if you need to design a function that is hard to implement in code start by designing the simplest version of that component.
- Don't over-engineer a design that it becomes impossible to finish and then you won't be able to ship anything before the due date.
