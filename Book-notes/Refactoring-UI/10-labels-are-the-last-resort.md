# Labels are a last resort
-  When displaying data you can easily make a mistake of handling each field like a label. By using this approach all your data will have equal emphasize and no visual hierarchy.
- If you're designing a card component make the name and their designation or title more emphasized in a hierarchical way respectively and then you can add their contact details. 
- Combining labels with a value can be a better to display information. In a pricing component that also shows the amount of stock for that item make the title and stock count of the same color and display it like "Only **12** left in stock". This will relay the message that this product is a high selling one.
- In designs like a dashboard, labels are not required and should be treated as a supporting content. The data displayed in the graphs on the dashboard is what matters most and should be easily readable.
- If you're building designs like a technical specifications table then you need to emphasize on the labels as you're displaying data in a table format
