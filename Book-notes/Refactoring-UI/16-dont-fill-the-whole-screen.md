# Don' t use the whole screen
If you only need 600px, use 600px. Spreading things out or making things
unnecessarily wide just makes an interface harder to interpret.

Give each element just the space it needs donâ€™t make something worse just to make it match something else.

Since most of the users use their mobiles for accessing the web try using a mobile-first approach, design for a smaller screen and then keep making the necessary adjustments for bigger screens. 

Using a column layout is also a great way to use extra screen real-estate but don't force your UIs to be crammed in small spaces if you want to use the extra space then use it.
