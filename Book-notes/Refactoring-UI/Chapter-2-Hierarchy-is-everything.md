## Not all elements are equal
- Styling an element is not the only thing that will make it look good. You'll also need the perfect visual hierarchy within your elements to really make them look good.
- Without proper visual hierarchy your designs will look noisy and un-organized. If you plan out visual hierarchy correctly in your designs even the most basic ones will look nice.

## Size isn't everything
- Relying solely on the size of your headings and body text to convey your message is a big mistake. Experiment with the font-weight and color as well the size.
- Making the heading bolder and changing the color of the supporting text to the accent color is a great way to represent hierarchy in headings.
- Use only a max of three color options (Primary, secondary, and accent) and only the minimum required amount of font-weights to emphasize and de-emphasize text.

## Don't use grey text everywhere
- If your background is white using a light grey shade will make it look nice but on colored backgrounds this will not work. Instead what you can do is choose a color that is closer to the background color.
- Using grey text on a background that is an image or has a pattern is also not recommended because if the text is to transparent it will make the pattern see through and this will effect users in reading the text.

## Emphasize by de-emphasizing
- Sometimes an element will require more emphasize but there will be room for it. For scenarios like these you can change the color that item. Like in a navigation bar change the colors of the active link to primary color or make the contact link more appealing by changing it's background.

## Labels are a last resort
-  When displaying data you can easily make a mistake of handling each field like a label. By using this approach all your data will have equal emphasize and no visual hierarchy.
- If you're designing a card component make the name and their designation or title more emphasized in a hierarchical way respectively and then you can add their contact details. 
- Combining labels with a value can be a better to display information. In a pricing component that also shows the amount of stock for that item make the title and stock count of the same color and display it like "Only **12** left in stock". This will relay the message that this product is a high selling one.
