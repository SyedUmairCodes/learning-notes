# Refactoring UI
- **Author:** Steve Schoger, Adam Wathan
- **Genre:** Design

# Size isn't everything
- Relying solely on the size of your headings and body text to convey your message is a big mistake. Experiment with the font-weight and color as well the size.
- Making the heading bolder and changing the color of the supporting text to the accent color is a great way to represent hierarchy in headings.
- Use only a max of three color options (Primary, secondary, and accent) and only the minimum required amount of font-weights to emphasize and de-emphasize text.
