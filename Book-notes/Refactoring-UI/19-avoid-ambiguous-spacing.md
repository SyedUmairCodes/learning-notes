# Avoid ambiguous spacing 
When groups of elements are explicitly separated, usually by a border or background color  it’s obvious which elements belong to which group. But when there isn’t a visible separator, it’s not always so obvious.

Keep guidelines for spacing between elements and icons, so that your users don't get confused and your UI looks nice, clean, and consistent.
