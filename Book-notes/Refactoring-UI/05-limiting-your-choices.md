# Refactoring UI
- **Author:** Steve Schoger, Adam Wathan
- **Genre:** Design

# Limiting your choices
- There are thousands and thousands of color and font parings that you can choose from. This is really useful and also this can paralyze you into wasting all of your time just playing around with color and font pairings. 
- This is where a design system comes to the rescue. Create a design system that will have pre-defined colors and their shades as well as fonts and font sizes for every heading and text fields.
Try to systematize everything even margins and borders.
-  A design system takes a lot of time to be perfect. Just start with the essentials like fonts and colors and keep on adding other styles as you work.
