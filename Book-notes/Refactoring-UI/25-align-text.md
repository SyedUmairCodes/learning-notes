# Text alignment
Align your text so that it has the best readability for the user. If the text is in a language that is read in  LTR  (left to right) like english the text should be left aligned. If it's in a RTL (right to left) like persian or arabic the text should be right aligned.

Other alignment options do have their place though, you just need to use them effectively. Like, center-alignment can look great for headlines or short, independent blocks of text.

Numbers should always be right aligned and when the decimal in a list of numbers is always in the same place, theyâ€™re a lot easier to compare at a glance.

Use hyphenation and justify text so that it will look good on the web as well as on print.
