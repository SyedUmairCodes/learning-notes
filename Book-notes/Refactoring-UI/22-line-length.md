# Line length
When designing components that render large amounts of text like a paragraph or blog post design the component so that it has the best reading experience for the user and don't try to fit all of the words in a few lines.

Make your paragraphs wide enough to fit between 45 and 75 characters per line. But, if you're mixing mixing paragraph text with images or other large components, you should still limit the paragraph width even if the overall content area needs to be wider to accommodate the other elements.
