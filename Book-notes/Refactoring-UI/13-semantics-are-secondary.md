# Semantics are secondary
When designing a component that has multiple actions that the user can perform than you should focus on the hierarchy of the elements and not about semantics.

If a card component has three buttons, the primary one should be bold and bright colored, the secondary button should a softer tone of the first button with a lower contrast and the third button could be a link and not a button. It should be there but it shouldn't be obvious.

This approach can also be taken with if the third or second option is a destructive one, you should always have a secondary confirmation step when desging destructive actions.
