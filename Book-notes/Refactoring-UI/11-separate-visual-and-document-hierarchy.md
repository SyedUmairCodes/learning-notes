# Separate visual and document hierarchy
When building for the web try to use semantic tags for headings, make sure your section titles look like headings and not labels.

The content should be the main attraction of a section not it's heading. Don’t let the element you’re using influence how you choose to style it. Pick elements for semantic purposes and style them however you need to create the best visual hierarchy.
