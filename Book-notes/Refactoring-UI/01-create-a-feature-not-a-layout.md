# Start with a feature, not a layout
- When you start creating a new design don't worry about the layout of the app you're creating and only focus on the most important components of the app. 
- Start designing the main features and components of the app you're creating. Sometimes you'll realize that you're app doesn't even need a navigation or a footer.
