# Links and Colors
If you add a external link in your text make sure that the link stands out from rest of the text. Make it "pop" by changing the font color and adding a underline to it.

Links in card components like news feeds don't need to "pop" don't give them a different color instead make the text bold and try to give it a nice shadow.

You don't have to emphasize on each link, If youâ€™ve got links in your interface that are really ancillary and not part of the main path a user takes through the application, consider adding an underline or changing the color only when the user hovers over them.
