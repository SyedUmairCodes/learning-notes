# Choosing a personality
- Every design has it's own personality. A corporate website or banking app might have a professional look and feel to it while the landing page for a new startup might offer fun and interactive vibes.
- Giving a personality to a design sounds like a tough job but it is rather easy if you follow the rules correctly.
-  Fonts matter a lot in design, If you want a professional looking type face you choose a serif type-face and if you're designing a website for a media agency you can use a handwritten font or a sans-serif fonts works best too. 
- Color is another important factor to consider when designing because each color responds to a different emotion in humans. There is a ton of studies that show that how a product is precieved just by using different colors. Blue feels familiar, Gold and silver feel expensive and sophisticated while pink, orange, and yellow have a colorful vibe to them.
- Rounded corners or straight corners in your designs also have a impact on how the user sees your design. This is a very small detail that shouldn't be overlooked. A small border doesn't do anything but gives your design a good layout hierarchy while a bigger border looks playful. Removing borders all-together will make your design look professional and business oriented.
- Using a formal tone in the text areas of the design such as instructions and greetings will give the sense of professionalism and using a casual tone will make your design more friendlier to the end-user.
- If you're a new designer on a team there will be a possibility that your team follows a design system which will give you pre-defined colors, fonts, and other design guidelines so that you won't have to think much about them.
-  Borrowing inspiration from other designers is a good thing but don't over due it to look like a cheap copy of their designs.
