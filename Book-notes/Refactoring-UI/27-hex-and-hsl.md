# Use HSL over Hexcodes
Hex codes and RGB values are the most commonly used formats for defining color codes for the web but they aren't the only options available.

Hue, Saturation, and Lightness or HSL for short, represents g colors using attributes the human-eye intuitively.

The **Hue** is the colors position on the wheel. It’s the attribute of a color that lets us identify two colors as “blue” even if they aren’t identical. Hue is measured in degrees, where 0° is red, 120° is green, and 240° is blue.

**Saturation** is how colorful or vivid a color looks. 0% saturation is grey (no color), and 100% saturation is vibrant and intense. Without saturation, hue is irrelevant changing the hue when saturation is 0% doesn’t actually change the color at all.

**Lightness** is just what it sounds like, it measures how close a color is to black or to white. 0% lightness is pure black, 100% lightness is pure white, and 50% lightness is a pure color at the given hue.
