# Use good fonts
With thousands of different typefaces out there to choose from, separating the good from the bad can be an intimidating task.

For UI design, your safest bet is a fairly neutral sans-serif — think something like Helvetica. You can also use the system default fonts, this is not the greatest option available but the user will be used seeing the font and the text will blend more with the system applications.

Don't pick a font-style that has five or less weights. Pick the ones that have more than seven or ten font weights so that you can play around with the font weights.

If a font is popular, it’s probably a good font. Most font directories will let you sort by popularity, so this can be a great way to limit your choices. You can also visit your favorite websites and check out which fonts they are using.
