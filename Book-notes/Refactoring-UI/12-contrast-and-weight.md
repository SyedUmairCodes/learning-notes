# Contrast and Weight
Bold text looks better than regular text because it uses more surface area than regular text. Icons also have this effect, If you place a solid icon next to normal text the icon will look more emphasized.

But, if you want to change the "weight" of an icon, you can't so designers usually make the color of the icon a lighter shade by lowering the contrast value of the icon. This also can work in vice-versa.
