## Start with a feature, not a layout
- When you start creating a new design don't worry about the layout of the app you're creating and only focus on the most important components of the app. 
- Start designing the main features and components of the app you're creating. Sometimes you'll realize that you're app doesn't even need a navigation or a footer. 

## Details come later
- In the beginning of a new design don't stress over the color schemes and fonts. You can change these things later on. Focus on the main layout of the component you're designing, where do the text fields go, where should the call-to-action button be placed. These are the things that you should focus on when starting a new design. 
- Create your initial designs in gray-scale and don't introduce color to the design until it is finalized. This will allow you to experiment with spacing, contrast and size of the design and you'll end up with a cleaner design that you can add color to whenever you want.
- Focus only on the initial design first then you can add the final touches or animations whenever you want.

## Don't design too much
- Figuring out every single edge case that can happen while the end-user is using your app is just not possible and you shouldn't try to solve them all. 
- You don't have to implement every single feature that your app is capable of in the beginning. Only design the essential features and then keep designing other features one by one and improving on the ones that are already built. 
- Don't design functions that you won't be able to implement in your app. Even if you need to design a function that is hard to implement in code start by designing the simplest version of that component.
- Don't over-engineer a design that it becomes impossible to finish and then you won't be able to ship anything before the due date.

## Choosing a personality
- Every design has it's own personality. A corporate website or banking app might have a professional look and feel to it while the landing page for a new startup might offer fun and interactive vibes.
- Giving a personality to a design sounds like a tough job but it is rather easy if you follow the rules correctly.
-  Fonts matter a lot in design, If you want a professional looking type face you choose a serif type-face and if you're designing a website for a media agency you can use a handwritten font or a sans-serif fonts works best too. 
- Color is another important factor to consider when designing because each color responds to a different emotion in humans. There is a ton of studies that show that how a product is precieved just by using different colors. Blue feels familiar, Gold and silver feel expensive and sophisticated while pink, orange, and yellow have a colorful vibe to them.
- Rounded corners or straight corners in your designs also have a impact on how the user sees your design. This is a very small detail that shouldn't be overlooked. A small border doesn't do anything but gives your design a good layout hierarchy while a bigger border looks playful. Removing borders all-together will make your design look professional and business oriented.
- Using a formal tone in the text areas of the design such as instructions and greetings will give the sense of professionalism and using a casual tone will make your design more friendlier to the end-user.
- If you're a new designer on a team there will be a possibility that your team follows a design system which will give you pre-defined colors, fonts, and other design guidelines so that you won't have to think much about them.
-  Borrowing inspiration from other designers is a good thing but don't over due it to look like a cheap copy of their designs.

## Limiting your choices
- There are thousands and thousands of color and font parings that you can choose from. This is really useful and also this can paralyze you into wasting all of your time just playing around with color and font pairings. 
- This is where a design system comes to the rescue. Create a design system that will have pre-defined colors and their shades as well as fonts and font sizes for every heading and text fields.
Try to systematize everything even margins and borders.
-  A design system takes a lot of time to be perfect. Just start with the essentials like fonts and colors and keep on adding other styles as you work.
