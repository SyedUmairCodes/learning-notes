# Public blockchains 
As the name suggests, public block-chains are not owned by anyone. They are open to the public, and anyone can participate as a node in the decision-making process.

Users may or may not be rewarded for their participation. All users of these "permissionless" or "un-permissioned" ledgers maintain a copy of the ledger on their local nodes and use a distributed consensus mechanism to decide the eventual state of the ledger. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both considered public block-chains.
