# Side-chains 
More precisely known as "pegged side-chains," this is a concept whereby coins can be moved from one block-chain to another and then back again. 

Typical uses include the creation of new alt-coins (alternative cryptocurrencies) whereby coins are burnt as a proof of an adequate stake. "Burnt" or "burning the coins" in this context means that the coins are sent to an address that is un-spendable, and this process makes the "burnt" coins irrecoverable. This mechanism is used to bootstrap a new currency or introduce scarcity, which results in the increased value of the coin. This mechanism is also called "proof-of=burn" and is used as an alternative method for distributed consensus to proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.
