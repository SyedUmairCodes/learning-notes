# The history of block-chain and Bitcoin
Block-chain was introduced with the invention of Bitcoin in 2008. Its practical implementation then occurred in 2009.

 All attempts to create anonymous and decentralized digital currency before bitcoin were successful to some extent, but they could not solve the problem of preventing double spending in a completely trust-less or permission-less environment.
 
This problem was finally addressed by the Bitcoin block-chain, which introduced the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
