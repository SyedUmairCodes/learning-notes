# Private block-chains 
As the name implies, private block-chains are just private. That is, they are open only to a consortium or group of individuals or organizations who have decided to share the ledger among themselves.

There are various block-chains now available in this category, such as Kadena and Quorum. Optionally, both of these block-chains can also run in public mode if required, but their primary purpose is to provide a private block-chain.
