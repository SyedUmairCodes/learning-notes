# Turing complete
A turing complete language means that it can perform any computation. It is named after Alan Turing, who developed the idea of a Turing machine that can run any algorithm however complex. Turing complete languages need loops and branching capability to perform complex computations.

To facilitate arbitrary program development on a block-chain, a Turing complete programming language is needed. Solidity is a turing complete programming language which is used to create smart contracts that can be deployed on the Ethereum block-chain.
