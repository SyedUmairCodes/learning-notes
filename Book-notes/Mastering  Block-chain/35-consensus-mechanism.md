# Consensus mechanism
A consensus mechanism is a set of steps that are taken by most or all nodes in a block-chain to agree on a proposed state or value.

For more than three decades, this concept has been researched by computer scientists in industry and academia. With the advent of block-chain and Bitcoin, consensus mechanisms have come into the limelight again and gained considerable popularity. 

There are various requirements for a consensus mechanism. The following describes these requirements:

- **Agreement:** All honest nodes decide on the same value.
- I**ntegrity:** This is a requirement that no node can make the decision more than once in a single consensus cycle. 
- **Validity:** The value agreed upon by all honest nodes must be the same as the initial value proposed by at least one honest node.
- **Fault tolerant:** The consensus algorithm should be able to run correctly in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes (Byzantine nodes). 
- **Termination:** All honest nodes terminate the execution of the consensus process and eventually reach a decision.
