# Distributed ledgers
All distributed ledgers are not necessarily block-chains. A critical difference between a distributed ledger and a block-chain is that a distributed ledger does not necessarily consist of blocks of transactions to keep the ledger growing. Rather, a block-chain is a special type of shared database that is comprised of blocks of transactions. Widely known block-chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum make use of blocks to update the shared database.

As the name suggests, a distributed ledger is distributed among its participants and spread across multiple sites or organizations. This type of ledger can be either private or public. The fundamental idea here is that, unlike many other block-chains, the records are stored contiguously instead of being sorted into blocks. This concept is used in Ripple, which is a block-chain- and cryptocurrency-based global payment network.
