# Updatable via consensus 
The most critical attribute of a block-chain is that it is update-able only via consensus. This is what gives it the power of decentralization. In this scenario, no central authority is in control of updating the ledger. 

Instead, any update made to the block-chain is validated against strict criteria defined by the block-chain protocol and added to the block-chain only after a consensus has been reached among all participating peers/nodes on the network. 

To achieve consensus, there are various consensus facilitation algorithms that ensure all parties agree on the final state of the data on the block-chain network and resolutely agree upon it to be true.
