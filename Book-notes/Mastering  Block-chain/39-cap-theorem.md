# CAP theorem and block-chain
The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, was introduced by Eric Brewer in 1998 as a conjecture. 

In 2002, it was proven as a theorem by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch. The theorem states that any distributed system cannot have consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously:

- **Consistency** is a property that ensures that all nodes in a distributed system have a single, current, and identical copy of the data.

	Consistency is achieved using consensus algorithms in order to ensure that all nodes have the same copy of the data. This is also called state machine replication. The block-chain is a means for achieving state machine replication.

- **Availability** means that the nodes in the system are up, accessible for use, and are accepting incoming requests and responding with data without any failures as and when required. In other words, data is available at each node and the nodes are responding to requests\

- **Partition tolerance** ensures that if a group of nodes is unable to communicate with other nodes due to network failures, the distributed system continues to operate correctly. This can occur due to network and node failures
