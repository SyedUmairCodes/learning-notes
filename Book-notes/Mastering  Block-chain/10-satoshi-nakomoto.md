# Satoshi Nakamoto
Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym of the creator of Bitcoin published a research paper called **Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System** 

This paper is available [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It introduced the term chain of blocks. No one knows the actual identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. After introducing Bitcoin in 2009, he remained active in the Bitcoin developer community until 2011.

He then handed over Bitcoin development to its core developers and simply disappeared. Since then, there has been no communication from him whatsoever, and his existence and identity are shrouded in mystery. The term "chain of blocks" evolved over the years into the word "block-chain."
