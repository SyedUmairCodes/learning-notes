# Fully private and proprietary block-chains
There is no mainstream application of these types of block-chains, as they deviate from the core concept of decentralization in block-chain technology.

An example of this type of block-chain might be to allow for collaboration and the sharing of data between various government departments. In that case, no complex consensus mechanism is required.
