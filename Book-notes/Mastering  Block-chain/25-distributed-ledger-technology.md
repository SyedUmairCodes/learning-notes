# Distributed Ledger Technology
In the finance industry, block-chain and DLT are used interchangeably. Though this is not entirely accurate, it is how the term has evolved recently, especially in the finance sector. 

In fact, DLT is now a very active and thriving area of research in the financial sector. From a financial sector point of view, DLTs are permissioned block-chains that are used by consortiums. 

DLTs usually serve as a shared database, with all participants known and verified. They do not have a cryptocurrency and do not require mining to secure the ledger.
