# Consensus
Consensus is the backbone of a block-chain, as it provides the decentralization of control through an optional process known as mining.

The choice of the consensus algorithm to utilize is governed by the type of block-chain in use. For example, in public permissionless block-chains, it would make sense to use proof-of-work instead of mechanisms that are more suitable for permissioned block-chains.

Consensus is a process of achieving agreement between distrusting nodes on the final state of data. To achieve consensus, different algorithms are used. It is easy to reach an agreement between two nodes, but when multiple nodes are participating in a distributed system and they need to agree on a single value, it becomes quite a challenge to achieve consensus.

This process of attaining agreement on a common state or value among multiple nodes despite the failure of some nodes is known as distributed consensus.
