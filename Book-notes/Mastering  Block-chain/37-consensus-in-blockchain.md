# Consensus in block-chain
Consensus is a distributed computing concept that has been used in block-chain in order to provide a means of agreeing to a single version of the truth by all peers on the block-chain network.

- Proof-based, leader-election lottery-based, or the Nakamoto consensus whereby a leader is elected at random (using an algorithm) and proposes a final value.

	This category is also referred to as the fully decentralized or permissionless type of consensus mechanism. This type is well used in the Bitcoin and Ethereum block-chain in the form of a proof-of-work mechanism. 

- Byzantine fault tolerance is a more traditional approach based on rounds of votes. This class of consensus is also known as the consortium or permissioned type of consensus mechanism.
