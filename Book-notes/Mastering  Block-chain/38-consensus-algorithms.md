# Consensus algorithms
The consensus algorithms available today, or that are being researched in the context of block-chain, are presented as follows:

- **Proof of Work:** This type of consensus mechanism relies on proof that adequate computational resources have been spent before proposing a value for acceptance by the network. 

	This scheme is used in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrency block-chains. Currently, it is the only algorithm that has proven to be astonishingly successful.

- **Proof of Stake:** This algorithm works on the idea that a node or user has an adequate stake in the system; that is, the user has invested enough in the system so that any malicious attempt by that user would outweigh the benefits of performing such an attack on the network.

	This idea was first introduced by Peercoin, and it is  used in the Ethereum block-chain version called Serenity. 

â€¢ **Delegated Proof of Stake:** This is an innovation over standard proof-of-stake, whereby each node that has a stake in the system can delegate the validation of a transaction to other nodes by voting.

- **Proof of Elapsed Time:** Introduced by Intel in 2016, it uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to provide randomness and safety in the leader election process via a guaranteed wait time. 

	It requires the Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) processor to provide the security guarantee for it to be secure. 

- **Proof of Deposit:** In this case, nodes that wish to participate in the network have to make a security deposit before they can mine and propose blocks. 

 - **Proof of Importance :** This idea is significant and different from proof-of-stake. It not only relies on how large a stake a user has in the system, but it also monitors the usage and movement of tokens by the user in order to establish a level of trust and importance.
 
- **Federated consensus or federated Byzantine consensus:** This mechanism is used in the stellar consensus protocol. Nodes in this protocol retain a group of publicly-trusted peers and propagate only those transactions that have been validated by the majority of trusted nodes.

- **Reputation-based mechanisms:** As the name suggests, a leader is elected by the reputation it has built over time on the network. It is based on the votes of other members.

- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** This mechanism achieves SMR, which provides tolerance against Byzantine nodes.

- **Proof of Activity:** This scheme is a combination of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work, which ensures that a stakeholder is selected in a pseudo-random but uniform fashion.

	This is a comparatively more energy-efficient mechanism as compared to proof-of-work.

- **Proof of Capacity:** This scheme uses hard disk space as a resource to mine the blocks. This is different from proof-of-work, where CPU resources are used. In proof-of-capacity, hard disk space is utilized for mining and, as such, is also known as hard drive mining. 

- **Proof of Storage:** This scheme allows for the outsourcing of storage capacity. This scheme is based on the concept that a particular piece of data is probably stored by a node, which serves as a means to participate in the consensus mechanism.

- **Proof of Authority:** This scheme utilizes the identity of the participants called validators as a stake on the network.

	Validators are known and have the authority to propose new blocks. Validators propose the new blocks and validate them as per block-chain rules.
