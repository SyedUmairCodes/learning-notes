# Permissioned ledger
A permissioned ledger is a block-chain where participants of the network are already known and trusted. 

Permissioned ledgers do not need to use a distributed consensus mechanism; instead, an agreement protocol is used to maintain a shared version of the truth about the state of the records on the block-chain.

In this case, for verification of transactions on the chain, all verifiers are already pre-selected by a central authority and, typically, there is no need for a mining mechanism.
