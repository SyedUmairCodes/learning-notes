# Semi-private block-chains
With semi-private block-chains, part of the block-chain is private and part of it is public. 

With a semi-private block-chain, the private part is controlled by a group of individuals, while the public part is open for participation by anyone. This hybrid model can be used in scenarios where the private part of the block-chain remains internal and shared among known participants, while the public part of the block-chain can still be used by anyone, optionally allowing mining to secure the block-chain. 

This way, the block-chain as a whole can be secured using proof-of-work, thus providing consistency and validity for both the private and public parts. 

This type of block-chain can also be called a "semi-decentralized" model, where it is controlled by a single entity but still allows for multiple users to join the network 
by following appropriate procedures.
