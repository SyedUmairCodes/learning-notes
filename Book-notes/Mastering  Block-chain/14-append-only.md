# Append-only
Another property of block-chains is that they are "append-only," which means that data can only be added to the block-chain in time-sequential order.

This property implies that once data is added to the block-chain, it is almost impossible to change that data and it can be considered practically immutable. In other words, blocks added to the block-chain cannot be changed, which allows block-chain to become an immutable and tamper-proof ledger of transactions.

However, remember that it can be changed in rare scenarios wherein collusion against the block-chain network by bad actors succeeds in gaining more than 51 percent of the power. Otherwise, the block-chain is practically immutable.

There may be some legitimate reasons to change data in the blockchain once it has been added, such as the "right to be forgotten" or "right to erasure"

However, those are individual cases that need to be handled separately and that require an elegant technical solution. For all practical purposes, block-chain is indeed immutable and cannot be changed.
