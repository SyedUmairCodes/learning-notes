# Token-less block-chains 
These block-chains are designed in such a way that they do not have the basic unit for the transfer of value.

However, they are still valuable in situations where there is no need to transfer value between nodes and only the sharing of data among various trusted parties is required. 

This is similar to fully private block-chains, the only difference being that the use of tokens is not required. This can also be thought of as a shared distributed ledger used for storing and sharing data between the participants.

It does have its benefits when it comes to immutability, tamper proofing, security, and consensus-driven updates. For example, Hyperledger Fabric or Quorum are token-less block-chains.
