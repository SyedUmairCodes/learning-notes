# Limitations of Block-chain
- **Scalability:** Currently, block-chain networks are not as scalable as, for example, current financial networks. This is a known area of concern and a very ripe area for research.
- **Adoption:** Block-chain is seen as a nascent technology. There is still a long way to go before the mass adoption of this technology. The challenge here is to allow block-chain networks to be easier to use so that adoption can increase.
- **Regulation:** Due to its decentralized nature, regulation is almost impossible on block-chain. This is sometimes seen as a barrier toward adoption because, traditionally, due to the existence of regulatory authorities, consumers have a certain level of confidence that if something goes wrong they can hold someone accountable.
- **Privacy and confidentiality:** Privacy is a concern on public block-chains such as Bitcoin where everyone can see every single transaction. This transparency is not desirable in many industries such as the financial, law, or medical sectors.
