# Distributed Vs Decentralized systems
In a distributed system, data and computation are spread across multiple nodes in the network. Sometimes, this term is confused with parallel computing. 

While there is some overlap in the definition, the main difference between these systems is that in a parallel computing system, computation is performed by all nodes simultaneously in order to achieve the result. 

The critical difference between a decentralized system and distributed system is that in a distributed system, there is still a central authority that governs the entire system, whereas in a decentralized system, no such authority exists.

A decentralized system is a type of network where nodes are not dependent on a single master node; instead, control is distributed among many nodes. This is analogous to a model where each department in an organization is in charge of its own database server, thus taking away the power from the central server and distributing it to the sub-departments, who manage their own databases. 

A significant innovation in the decentralized paradigm that has given rise to this new era of decentralization of applications is decentralized consensus. This mechanism came into play with Bitcoin, and it enables a user to agree on something via a consensus algorithm without the need for a central, trusted third party, intermediary, or service provider. 

This is the key difference between decentralized and distributed networks. A decentralized system may look like a distributed system from a topological point of view, but it doesn't have a central authority that controls the network.
