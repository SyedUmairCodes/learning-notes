# Benefits of Block-chains
- **Decentralization:** This is a core concept and benefit of block-chain. There is no need for a trusted third party or intermediary to validate transactions; instead, a consensus mechanism is used to agree on the validity of transactions.
- **Transparency and trust:** As block-chains are shared and everyone can see what is on the block-chain, this allows the system to be transparent. As a result, trust is established.

	This is more relevant in scenarios such as the disbursement of funds or benefits where personal discretion in relation to selecting beneficiaries needs to be restricted.

- **Immutability:** Once the data has been written to the block-chain, it is extremely difficult to change it back. It is not genuinely immutable, but because changing data is so challenging and nearly impossible, this is seen as a benefit to maintaining an immutable ledger of transactions.
- **Cost-saving:** As no trusted third party or clearing house is required in the blockchain model, this can massively eliminate overhead costs in the form of the fees, which are paid to such parties.
