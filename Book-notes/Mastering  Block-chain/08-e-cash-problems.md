# Problems with Electronic cash
Electronic cash has two major problems accountability and anonymity. 

## Accountability
Accountability is required to ensure that cash is spendable only once and that it can only be spent by its rightful owner. The double-spending problem arises when the same money can be spent twice.

As it is quite easy to make copies of digital data, this becomes a big issue in digital currencies as you can make many copies of the same amount of digital cash.

## Anonymity
Anonymity is required to protect users' privacy. With physical cash, it is almost impossible to trace back spending to the individual who actually paid the money, which provides adequate privacy should the consumer choose to hide their identity. 

In the digital world, however, providing such a level of privacy is difficult due to tracing, and logging mechanisms in digital payment systems such as credit card payments. 

This is due to the fact that end users do not have any control over who their data might be shared with, even without their consent.

Nevertheless, this is a solvable problem and cryptography is used to address such issues. Especially in block-chain networks, the privacy and anonymity of the participants on the block-chain are sought-after features. 

David Chaum solved both of these problems during his work in the 1980s by using two cryptographic operations, namely, blind signatures and secret sharing.  For the moment, it is sufficient to say that blind signatures allow for signing a document without actually seeing it, and secret sharing is a concept that enables the detection of double-spending, that is, using the same e-cash token twice. In 2009, the first practical implementation of an e-cash system named Bitcoin appeared.
