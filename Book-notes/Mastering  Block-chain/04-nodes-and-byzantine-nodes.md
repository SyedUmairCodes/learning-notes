# Nodes and Byzantine Nodes
A node can be defined as an individual player in a distributed system. All nodes are capable of sending and receiving messages to and from each other. Nodes can be honest, faulty, or malicious, and they have memory and a processor. 

A node that exhibits irrational behavior is also known as a Byzantine node after the Byzantine Generals problem.
