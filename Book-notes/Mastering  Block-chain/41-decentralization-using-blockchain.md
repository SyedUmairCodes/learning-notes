# Decentralization using block-chain
Decentralization is a core benefit and service provided by block-chain technology. By design, block-chain is a perfect vehicle for providing a platform that does not need any intermediaries and that can function with many different leaders chosen via consensus mechanisms. 

This model allows anyone to compete to become the decision-making authority. A consensus mechanism governs this competition, and the most famous method is known as proof-of-work. Decentralization is applied in varying degrees from a semi-decentralized model to a fully decentralized one depending on the requirements and circumstances. 

Decentralization can be viewed from a block-chain perspective as a mechanism that provides a way to remodel existing applications and paradigms, or to build new applications, to give full control to users.
