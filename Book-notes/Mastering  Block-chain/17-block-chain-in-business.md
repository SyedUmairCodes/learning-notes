# Block-chain in business
From a business standpoint, a block-chain can be defined as a platform where peers can exchange value/e-cash using transactions without the need for a centrally trusted arbitrator. 

For example, for cash transfers, banks act as a trusted third party. In financial trading, a central clearing house acts as a trusted third party between two or more trading parties. This concept is compelling, and, once you absorb it, you will realize the enormous potential of block-chain technology. 

This disintermediation allows block-chain to be a decentralized consensus mechanism where no single authority is in charge of the database. Immediately, you'll see a significant benefit of decentralization here, because if no banks or central clearing houses are required, then it immediately leads to cost savings, faster transaction speeds, and more trust.
