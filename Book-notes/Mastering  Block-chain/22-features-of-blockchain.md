# Features of Block-chain

- **High availability:** As the system is based on thousands of nodes in a peer-to-peer network, and the data is replicated and updated on every node, the system becomes highly available. 

	Even if some nodes leave the network or become inaccessible, the network as a whole continues to work, thus making it highly available. This redundancy results in high availability.

- **Highly secure:** All transactions on a block-chain are crypto-graphically secured and thus provide network integrity. Any transactions posted from the nodes on the block-chain are verified based on a predetermined set of rules. 

	Only valid transactions are selected for inclusion in a block. The block-chain is based on proven cryptographic technology that ensures the integrity and availability of data. 

-  **Simplification of current paradigms:** The current block-chain model in many industries, such as finance or health, is somewhat disorganized. In this model, multiple entities maintain their own databases and data sharing can become very difficult due to the disparate nature of the systems. 

	However, as a block-chain can serve as a single shared ledger among many interested parties, this can result in simplifying the model by reducing the complexity of managing the separate systems maintained by each entity

- **Faster dealings:** In the financial industry, especially in post-trade settlement functions, block-chain can play a vital role by enabling the quick settlement of trades. Block-chain does not require a lengthy process of verification, reconciliation, and clearance because a single version of agreed-upon data is already available on a shared ledger between financial organizations.

- **Platform for smart contracts:** A block-chain is a platform on which programs can run that execute business logic on behalf of the users. 

	This is a very useful feature but not all block-chains have a mechanism to execute smart contracts.
