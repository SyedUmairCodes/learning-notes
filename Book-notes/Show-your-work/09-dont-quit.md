# Don't quit.
- Life is full of ups and downs. You will have to learn to live with them if you want do fulfill your dreams.
- Quitting pre-maturely or just because you aren't doing well isn't a great excuse to throw away whatever  you've accomplished in your life.
- Like a chain-smoker lights a cigarette before the current one finishes you should also start thinking about your next project before your current one finishes.
