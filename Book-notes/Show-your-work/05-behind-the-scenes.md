# Behind the scenes
- Most of your audience won't be interested in your daily routine. How you manage to find inspiration and what is your process to create a product. They just want to look at the finished product and not the details of how you made it.
- There will be a few people that will want to know every single detail in full because they are so impressed by your work that they want to steal your secrets.
- Documenting your day-to-day activities is one of the best ways to show your work.
