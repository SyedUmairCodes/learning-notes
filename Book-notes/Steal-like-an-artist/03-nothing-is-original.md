# Nothing is original
- Nine out of ten times when a person tells you that something is original they just don't know the original source or reference.
- We should not try to re-invent the wheel bu instead try to create a more improved version of it.
- If we look closely, each new idea or invention is just mix-up of previous ideas and inventions.
- You should only collect selected ideas that inspire you and not hoard every single idea that you come across.
- Find a mentor, and focus on him and not his work then find three people that your mentor follows and start following them repeat this cycle until you become a mentor.
