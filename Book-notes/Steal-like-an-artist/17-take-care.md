# Take care
- You need to take care of yourself. Eat healthy, workout, socialize, and do stuff that makes you happy.
- You won't be alive forever, make the most of your time doing the things you love and make sure that the things you do leave a positive impact on the world.
- Save money, don't fall for the latest trends, or the newest gadgets when your old ones are perfectly fine.  
- Always find time for your side projects and hobbies. Even if you work a full-time job there are moments in your day where you can find the time for a little bit of creativity on the side.
