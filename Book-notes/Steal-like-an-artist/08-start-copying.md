# Start copying
- Your own unique style of work will develop when you copy others. Keep copying different people and then mix the aspects of each that you like the most. - That is your own style.
- Don't steal others work and say that you made it. Steal it and the reverse-engineer it to make it look like you made it from scratch. - You will also learn all the ins-and-outs of the other persons work.
- Find who you want to copy from, then find out what you want to copy from them.
- Humans cannot copy something 100% perfectly, there will always be flaws in it.
