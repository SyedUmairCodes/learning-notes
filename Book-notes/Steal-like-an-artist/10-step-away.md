# Step away
- You won't get any inspiration from just sitting around in-front of your computer screen. Sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty.
- If you do all of your work in a computer you won't be able to feel how this works or be able to learn what happens behind the screen.
- Go out, have a picnic, get together with old friends, walk your dog. Doing stuff with your own hands will inspire you more than you could ever think of.
