# Uniqueness
- You are unique, every thought, every expression of you is unique. The world may not notice this but it is your responsibility to know how much valuable you are.
- A creative mind can never be satisfied. It will always be looking for the big thing which makes him different from others.
- Sometimes you just have to get lost in your work. Move away from our friends and family and start living in the world that we created.
