# Our stories 
- Sometimes we may think that weâ€™re in charge, or that we have things figured out.
- Things in life don't always go as planned. Sometimes we are at the top of the world and it only takes a few moments to fall down to ground. When this happens you must have the courage to stand back up and climb again to reach the top.
- The stories that make up your life, you don't choose them they choose you.
