# Over excitement
 - Don't get too much excited over anything. Try to limit your brain to things that matter the most. 
 - When your working the outside world feels a new toy and you feel like a baby. You just want that new toy.
 - Don't get distracted by the outside world or what is happening in the world, This way you'll lose focus over your work and sometimes even forget what you were working on.
