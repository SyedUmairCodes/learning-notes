# Practice daily
- Have a bulletin board in your room to quickly tackle down ideas and inspirations.
- Complete your work then browse social media or you will be lost in it for the entire day.
- Sit down daily and just work. It doesn't need to be your greatest work but just ordinary work that you do daily and one day it will turn into your greatest work.
