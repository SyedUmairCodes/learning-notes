# Forms
- If you are building a form or any type of user-interface make sure to use native-input features. If the form has a field where you have to input an integer make sure to use the on-screen keyboard that is the num-pad rather than the full qwerty keyboard.
- Hide user passwords in the password field using *** or black dots but also provide an icon for him to paste into the password field.
- Don't clear forms automatically. Only perform this action if the user asks for it.
- The size of the input fields in forms matters a lot. make sure a field is not too big or too small for the user.
- Make your forms to ask for as less information as possible. Why does a social media site need a users ZIP code and address?
- If a user logs into your app and forgets his/ her password and clicks on the forgot password link you should auto-fill the recovery email field with his email this makes for better user experience.
- In-app search results should always show the most relatable content on the top and less relatable after that.
- Make it easier for the user to input credit card and postal code address in the forms.
- In your form controls use both placeholders and labels. The label tells the user what to put in this field and the placeholder tells him that how to put it.
