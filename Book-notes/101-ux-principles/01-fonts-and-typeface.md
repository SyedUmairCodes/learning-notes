# Fonts and typefaces
- Don't use more than two types of fonts in your applications because it will make it harder for the user to concentrate on the text.
- Always use a fallback font if you are using custom fonts through a CDN like google fonts. The fallback will work until the custom font loads.
- Use Headings and sub-headings properly to direct the user to the most important things first. Using a font size of 16px and a line-height of 1.5 is considered the gold standard for text in user-interface design
- Use an ellipsis(...) next to text to convey that there are more options available.
