# Mobile design
- If you have a mobile app, occasionally remind your users for a rating but don't shove it in their throats.
- Create a simple splash screen for your mobile. Don't embed your "Company visions" into the splash screen. Load the app as quick as possible so that the user can do his work.
- Make your app icon or website fav-icon unique and recognizable.
- Try to add a import existing or create from existing workflow in your app has a feature that other apps also have. This makes the user feel at home and makes his on-boarding faster.
- On mobile devices use a slide-in navigation to make users show there are more items in the menu.
- Always save the users position if your app uses infinite scroll because no one wants to keep scrolling forever. 
- Avoid using hamburger menus for less than 5 menu items. You can instead use a bottom or tabbed navigation instead of a hamburger menu.
