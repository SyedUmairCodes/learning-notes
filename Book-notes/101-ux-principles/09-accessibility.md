- Show, don't tell. Create video tutorials about complex UI in your app. Allow users to see and do what they want instead of telling them.
- You app should have a balanced default options that match most of the users default behavior so that they don't fiddle in the settings and just get their work done.
- Try to make your apps UX familiar to a new user so that they carry their previous knowledge and be more productive while using your app
- Make your app simple as possible. The more simple your UX will be the more users will flock to it.
- Designers are trained to invent their own unique way of design and not to copy others. UX designers on the other hand are complete opposite of this law. Your UX should be similar to the most popular app in your niche because it will help new user feel at home.
- Add simple on-boarding illustrations to users dashboards if there are no items in it. (You can show a plus icon and then a add more button.)
- On-boarding or getting started tips sometimes tend to annoy users. Make sure that they are easily dismiss-able.
- Show the last unread message or notification on the top. Give your users the ability to refresh the feed themselves.
- Make your app case-insensitive. "John" and "john" should be displayed same in your UI.	
- The contrast ratio of your text to your background must be 7.5:1 for maximum readability.
- If your app shows a red notification for alerts and green for success messages. It is useless for a user that is blind or visually impaired. The best option is to notify the user through both alerts and sounds.
- If you have a notifications feature in your app make sure the user can customize the amount and frequency of the notifications he receives.
- If your user is new user and is using your app for the first time. make sure there is a "skip this" link on your on-boarding page.
- Hide "Advanced settings" most users. Only give access to the power users to these settings.
