# Saving data
- If the user does anything that needs to be saved auto save it. If not, tell him through a pop-up modal to save his work or show it in the title bar. "Document-1 (Unsaved)" the asterisk symbol can also be used to show an unsaved document.
- Your users don't know how the file system of their devices works. Make it dead-simple for them to save and retrieve files from their system that your app needs.
