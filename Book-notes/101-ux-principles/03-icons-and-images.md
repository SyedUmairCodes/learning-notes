# Icons and images
- Only use icons that are consistent. Inconsistent icons make the user confused and wastes their time try to include icons only where necessary.
- Each icon has a meaning. don't misplace icons in your UI and don't use out-dated icons for new projects.
- Don't include text "inside" the icon, place your text around the icon not inside it.
- If you want to deliver simple and meaningful icons to your customers just use Emojis. Almost all of your users will be able to recognize emojis.
- Progress bars should be linear and should show an integer value to show much the current task has been completed(20%, 50%...)
- Spinner loading bard should show text below them that says loading... or still loading... This makes the user at ease.
