# Buttons and other controls
- While making a button make sure it looks like a proper button. when clicked/touched it should be pressed backwards and should have text like click here, press here, etc...
- Make your buttons big enough so that the user can click them easily. Make the whole button clickable and not just the text.
- Don't invent new controls. There are already a lot of UI controls that you can use in your app like Scroll-bars, check boxes, dials, etc.. Don't make a new control that your users will need to learn first and then use it.
- Slider controls should only be used for Volume, brightness, and color mixing controls and not for a fixed integer value.
- Use drop-down menus only on mobile devices because you can use check boxes on bigger screens.
- The search bar should be labeled with the placeholder of "Search..." and the button should have a magnifying glass icon.Hide the search bar on small screens and only show it when the search button is clicked.
- Always double check a critical action in your app. An e-commerce website should show a pop-up modal containing all the items in the cart before the user confirms his order so that he doesn't order the wrong items.
- Pagination is used for showing a finite number of items. like the products available on a e-commerce website. Infinite scroll is used when you want to show infinite number of items such as social media feeds to keep him addicted to the app.
- Make your links look like links. Make them visually look like a like.
- Split your menu items into sub-categories of seven items each. Because humans cannot remember more than seven items in a list.
- You top navigation should also be repeated in the footer links section. Don't make the footer a deadly-end section and include a search bar or subscribe to newsletter section in it.
- Add filters and sorting order in your apps search to make searching easier for your users.
- If your user is too deep in your apps a great way to show them exactly where they are is using breadcrumbs for navigation.
