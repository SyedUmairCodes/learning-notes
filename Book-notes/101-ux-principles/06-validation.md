# Validation
- Implement client-side validation in your user interface. Your form should not make a "round-trip" to the server just to validate the correct syntax of an email address.
- Even if you do server-side validation. make sure the user clearly sees it.
- Don't validate phone number on the user-interface, just let the user add his number. on mobile devices use the dedicated num-pad and not the qwerty keyboard.
