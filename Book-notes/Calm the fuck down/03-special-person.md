# Calm the fuck down
- **Author:** Sarah Knight
- **Genre:** Self-help, Mental health

# Special person
Most of us have a friend, relative, or partner whose inevitable reaction to our every crisis is “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be okay.” Or worse: “Aw, it’s not so bad.”

by saying “everything’s going to be okay,” your friend/relative/partner is probably just trying to help you

On that, I call bullshit. Well-meaning platitudes are easy to offer for someone with no skin in the game. but it's still something to celebrate about because not everyone has the luxury of dumping their emotional load onto someone else.
