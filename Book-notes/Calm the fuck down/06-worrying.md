# Worrying
**Worrying** has two separate but related meanings. In addition to the act of anxiously fretting about one’s problems, worrying also means constantly fiddling with something, rubbing at it, tearing it open, and making it worse.

It’s like noticing that your sweater has a dangling thread, maybe the beginnings of a hole. And it’s natural to want to pull on it. You’re getting a feel for the problem, measuring its potential impact. How bad is it already? What can I do about it?

But if you keep pulling—and then tugging, yanking, and fiddling instead of taking action to fix it—suddenly you’re down a whole sleeve, you’re freaking out, and both your state of mind and your sweater are in tatters. I’ve seen smaller piles of yarn at a cat café.

When you get into this state of mind, you’re not just worried about something; you’re actually worrying it. And in both senses, worrying makes the problem worse.
