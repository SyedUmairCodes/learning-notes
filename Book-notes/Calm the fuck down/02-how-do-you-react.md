# How do you react
When shit happens, how do you react? Do you freeze or do you freak out? Do you lock the bathroom door and cry or do you howl at the sky with rage? 

Unfortunately, while these coping mechanisms can be comforting, none are especially productive. Eventually you have to stop freaking out and start dealing with your shit, and it’s hard to make decisions and solve problems when you’re panicking or sobbing or shouting, or when all the blood is rushing to your head.
Which is why what you really need to do, first and foremost, is calm the fuck down.
