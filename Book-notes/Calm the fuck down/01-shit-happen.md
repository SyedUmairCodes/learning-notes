# Shit happens
When we wake up in the morning our main goal is to get through the day. Some people are looking for  success, a bit of relaxation, or a kind word from a loved one. Others are just hoping not to get arrested for treason.

Each twenty-four-hour cycle brings the potential for good things to happen,  your loan gets approved, your girlfriend proposes, your socks match but thereâ€™s also the chance that a big steaming pile of shit will land in your lap. Your house could get repossessed, your girlfriend might break up with you, your socks may get stolen or you get lost.

Not to mention the potential for earthquakes, tornados, military coups, nuclear accidents, and all manner of disasters that could strike at any time and really fuck up your shit.
