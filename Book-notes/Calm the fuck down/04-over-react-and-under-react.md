# Over-reacting or Under-reacting
Sometimes things will be okay. You pass the test, the tumor comes back benign, Linda returns your text.But sometimes they won’t. Investments go south, friendships fall away.

In some cases, it’s really not so bad, and you are overreacting. You’ve built an imagined crisis up in your head and let it feed your anxiety like a mogwai after dark. If you’ve seen Gremlins, you know how this ends.

But in other cases **IT’S REAL BAD BRO**, and you? You’re under-reacting. You’re like that cartoon dog who sits at a table drinking coffee while the house burns down around him thinking It’s fine.
