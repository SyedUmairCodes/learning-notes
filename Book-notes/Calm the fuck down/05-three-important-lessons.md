# Three important lessons

## Lesson #1: 
Merely believing that things will be okay or aren’t so bad may make you feel better in the moment, but it won’t solve the problem. And a lot of times it doesn’t even feel good in the moment. Either way, it doesn’t change a goddamn thing!
	
## Lesson #2: 
When shit happens, circumstances are what they are: tires are flat, wrists are broken, files are deleted, hamsters are dead. You may be frustrated, anxious, hurt, angry, or sad but you are right there in the thick of it and the only thing you can control in this equation is YOU, and your reaction.

## Lesson #3:
To survive and thrive in these moments, you need to **acknowledge** what’s happened, **accept** the parts you can’t control, and **address** the parts you can.
