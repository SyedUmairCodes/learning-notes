# Why startups fail
- Conflict between startup founders is probably the leading cause of startup death. Be very careful who you go into business with. It helps to have worked on projects with them before, so you can get a sense of how well you work together.
- Another great reason why most startups fail is that they take huge risks. In the beginning start small and take small risks. Don't blow all of your capital on a single investment that you aren't sure about.
