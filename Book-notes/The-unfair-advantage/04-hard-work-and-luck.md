# The Unfair Advantage
- **Author**: Ash Ali, Hassan Kuba
- **Genre**: Self-help, Non-fiction, Business

# Hard work and luck
- Many books that are of the self-help genre tend to have a common theme that says there is no thing as talent and every thing is about hard work. This statement is completely false.
- Sure there are many people who worked so hard that everybody knows their names now, but there are also people you were just lucky and had a natural talent for the things that they do.
- If you want to be super-ultra successful, find your talent and then work hard on it.
