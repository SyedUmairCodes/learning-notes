# Fundraising
- First of all, remember that you’re not starting a company to raise money, you’re doing it to serve customers, clients or users, and make a profit, and ideally have some kind of positive impact in the world. Always keep that in mind.
- Before you start raising funds for your product you'll need a strong product that is worth investing in.
- When approaching an investor for funding always make your introduction as concise as possible. Use simple words and avoid any type of jargon or marketing tactics.
