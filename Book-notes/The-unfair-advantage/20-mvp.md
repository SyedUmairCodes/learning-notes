# Build an MVP 
- Starting off by building a minimum viable product is the best approach to launch your product in the market. You'll get an idea of how good your product actually is, how good it performs, and how much do the people like it.
- A MVP usually doesn't have any bells and whistles. It only has the minimum required features and allows you to add features based on customer feedback.
