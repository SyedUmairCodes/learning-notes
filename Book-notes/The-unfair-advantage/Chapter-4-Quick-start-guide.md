## People only show you their shiny things.

- Social media influences are the biggest liars because they don't tell you about how hard they had to struggle to get where they are today. They'll just show you their fancy houses and cars and fool you.
- The hard work and struggle is usually not shown by any celebrity because they want you to think that their life has always been about luxury. But it's not true you can also live the life of your dreams if you use your unfair advantages correctly.

## Startup Vs. Regular job
- Launching a startup is no walk in the park. You'll face many challenges and will discover many new things. It will be all worth it in the end.
- Being an employee has its own perks as well you have the stability and set career path that your role gives you.

## Find your why
- If you don't know why you want to start a startup you've already failed. First you must decide why are creating a solution or product.
- You can have any reason to create a your own product or company there is no right or wrong reason for this. Maybe you want the luxurious lifestyle of a CEO or you want the fame, glory, and respect that big influential people get. Whatever the reason you just need to give it your all if you want to succeed.

## Types of statups
- A life style startup is a type of startup that caters to certain group of people and the lifestyle they follow. If you create healthy granola bars for people who do keto you'll only attract the people that follow the keto diet.
- Digital product or a hyper growth startup is what that wants to scale as quickly as possible. You'll create a product or service that is not limited by geographic location and then sell it to people all around the world.

## Ideas
- Ideas without execution are meaningless. Doesn't matter if your idea is old you can apply it to a different field and it could be revolutionary.
- Investors don't want to invest in ideas like this, they only want to invest in ideas that are capable of disturbing entire industries or put a company out of business.
- If your idea is completely new you'll have to educate your users about your service. The second company that mimics you won't have to deal with that because you've already done the ground work for them.
- If you can't find an idea that can change a persons life or disrupt an entire industry try to think of a problem that you have in your daily life and try solving that.

## Get copied or be bought
- In the digital age if you launch a unique product that people like there are many such chances that your idea will be bought by the big boys or they will copy it. This is something that you need to keep in mind.
- Most successful startups follow this pattern like google, Facebook, and amazon. 

## Find the A-Team
- Founding a hyper growth startup alone can cause a bad effect on both your mental and physical health as well as you'll always be occupied in your startup that you'll barely have time for family and friends.
- Your team should only consist of three to four persons only. You'll require three main roles which are the communicator, the visionary, and the technician.
- The visionary is the one who came up with the idea and wants to solve a problem. The communicator is the one that markets your product and gets the word out to the people and brings in investors. Finally, the technician is the one who creates the actual product and decides which features should be added or removed from it.

## Your mental health is more important
- Creating a product all on your is very dangerous for both your physical and mental health because all of your time will be spent working on your ideas that you won't have time for family and friends or go out for any activity.

## Why startups fail
- Conflict between startup founders is probably the leading cause of startup death. Be very careful who you go into business with. It helps to have worked on projects with them before, so you can get a sense of how well you work together.
- Another great reason why most startups fail is that they take huge risks. In the beginning start small and take small risks. Don't blow all of your capital on a single investment that you aren't sure about.

## Build an MVP 
- Starting off by building a minimum viable product is the best approach to launch your product in the market. You'll get an idea of how good your product actually is, how good it performs, and how much do the people like it.
- A MVP usually doesn't have any bells and whistles. It only has the minimum required features and allows you to add features based on customer feedback.

## Fundraising
- First of all, remember that you’re not starting a company to raise money, you’re doing it to serve customers, clients or users, and make a profit, and ideally have some kind of positive impact in the world. Always keep that in mind.
- Before you start raising funds for your product you'll need a strong product that is worth investing in.
- When approaching an investor for funding always make your introduction as concise as possible. Use simple words and avoid any type of jargon or marketing tactics.
