# Find the A-Team
- Founding a hyper growth startup alone can cause a bad effect on both your mental and physical health as well as you'll always be occupied in your startup that you'll barely have time for family and friends.
- Your team should only consist of three to four persons only. You'll require three main roles which are the communicator, the visionary, and the technician.
- The visionary is the one who came up with the idea and wants to solve a problem. The communicator is the one that markets your product and gets the word out to the people and brings in investors. Finally, the technician is the one who creates the actual product and decides which features should be added or removed from it.
