# Remove Distractions
- The most hardest part about becoming disciplined is that there so many things that can distract you. If you are disciplining yourself to stop smoking, you could stop meeting your smoking buddies (people with whom you smoke frequently) for awhile until you have gained complete restraint, or you could stop visiting the spots where you smoked frequently.
- You can't discipline yourself if you rely on immediate gratification as a trigger for feeling good. You should train your brain into thinking that this quick pleasures and no match for the pleasure and satusfaction that you'll recieve once you've accomplished a big achievement.
- Distract yourself from what is distracting you. Your brain only needs five minutes to motivate it to keep doing the thing that you don't want to do.
