# Difference between Self-Discipline and Willpower
- Will power is necessary to get you started, you need self-discipline if you truly want to realize your true potential. Willpower simply catapults you to action and as such is likely to be powerful but temporary, which means that you need something that can keep you going until the very end.
- Self-discipline gives you the stamina to persevere in whatever you do. It gives you the ability to withstand difficulties whether they are emotional or mental. Additionally, self-discipline gives you the ability to reject instant gratification for greater good (for something better) even if this requires a lot more effort and time.
- Both compliment each other and without one the other cannot work.
