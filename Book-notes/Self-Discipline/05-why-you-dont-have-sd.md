# Why you don't have Self-Discipline
- Self-discipline is not something you are born with; it is something you work on and develop. The disciplined have worked hard to build this strength and those who do not have it need to put in effort to acquire it.
- A positive environment is mandatory in the development of self-discipline and willpower. If the people around you are not supportive and constantly demoralize you, you will never be able to discern right and wrong, and discipline yourself.
- The fear of failing at something often keeps us from taking an initiative. When you cannot initiate tasks and activities, you cannot move towards your goals. This lowers your inner strength, an integral and essential part of developing willpower.
- To be self-disciplined, your life must have a purpose, a goal you look forward to, and stay dedicated to. On the contrary, if you do not know your lifelong objectives, and have not realized them yet, you are likely to have a lacking self-discipline.
