# Ignore the numbers
Money and online metrics such as likes, followers, and shares on your social media posts can corrupt the artist inside you. It can be very tempting to only post those things that the people like and not post the things that you like.

These metrics are shallow in real life. If a person follows you on Twitter it doesn't mean that he likes your work, maybe he could be someone that despises you and constantly stalks you and is looking for one drunk post that you make to end your career. 

If you live your life according to the metrics data of your social media or online blog that you'll live a very sad life.
