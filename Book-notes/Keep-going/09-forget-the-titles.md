# Forget your titles and focus on your work
Job titles can be misleading, Sometimes people put too much in their profile descriptions that you'll think that this person can do everything and you can't.

In reality, A title is nothing. You just need to focus on doing the things you love and forget these made-up titles. Let go of the thing that youâ€™re trying to be, and focus on the actual work you need to be doing.
