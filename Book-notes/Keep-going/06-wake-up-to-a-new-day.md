# Wake up to a new day
Grabbing our phones and checking the news is the first thing a lot of people do in the morning. Doing this will only cause you to have anxiety and panic attacks as soon as you wake up.

Doing the things that need to be done first and then checking your phone is the ideal way to start your day because the bad news will never stop coming then why should you stop and lose your focus over something that has nothing to do with you.

There are so many better ways to wake up: Head to your bliss station, eat breakfast, stretch, do some exercises, take a walk, run, listen to Mozart, shower, read a book, play with your kids, or just be silent for a bit. Even if itâ€™s for fifteen minutes, give yourself some time in the morning to not be completely horrified by the news.
