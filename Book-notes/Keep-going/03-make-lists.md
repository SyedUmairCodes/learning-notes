# Make lists
To-do lists are a great way to calm down your anxiety levels. By writing down the things that you need to do in a day helps you visualize your tasks and doesn't let them overwhelm you.

If you're not certain about a task that you should do or something that you should learn or not just make a list. Create two columns on a piece of paper and write the pros and cons of the task. If the pros outweigh the cons then continue if not then do something else.
