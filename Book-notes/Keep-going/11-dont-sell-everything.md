# Don't monetize your hobbies
A hobby is something that we do when we just want to relax or enjoy our time. Some like to bake, some write, and some even make clay pots.

No matter what your hobby is if enjoy doing it you'll become good at it and if you show it to someone their first response is going to be that you should do it as a "side hustle".

When you turn something you love into your job you'll end up hating it because it won't be fun anymore. But this doesn't mean that you shouldn't choose to start a business over a regular job it just means that don't try to sell everything. Keep something that soothes you only to yourself.
