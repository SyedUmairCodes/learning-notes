# Keep playing
If you treat your work like work you'll soon get tired and bored of it but if you treat it like a game and play it will be much more fun for you.

All the great people in the world think of doing their work as simply playing with their tools and they focus on enjoying the creative process and not the end result.'

Nothing makes play more fun than some new toys. Seek out unfamiliar tools and materials. Find something new to fiddle with.
