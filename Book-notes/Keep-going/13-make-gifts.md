# Make gifts
When you start getting bored and feel like you're losing your spark and everything starts becoming dull then you should just stop for a while.

Stop, and do something else. Spend time with family and friends, make gifts for them, teach others your art, do volunteer work. You never know how much a small act of kindness can help someone.
