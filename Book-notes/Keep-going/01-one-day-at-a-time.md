# One day at a time
If someone asks you "What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?" What will be your answer?

Each person will have his own answer to this question according to his own life. If he is wealthy and successful he will say that this is the perfect life and if not he would just want his misery to end in one way or another.

Creativity is not a linear process that once you build a strong foundation you'll just keep scaling upwards, no. Creativity is a circle where each new project starts from the ground up every day.

Think of your life as you only have today to accomplish whatever you want because tomorrow will never come. Each day is the and it resets every night at 12-o-clock.
