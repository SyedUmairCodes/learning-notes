# Australian extinction
- Humans reached Europe and East Asia about 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea and landed in Australia, the continent untouched by humans.
- Humans quickly wiped out most of the wild plants and killed the animals that lived in ancient australia for their own means. Since the wildlife of austraila never knew about humans they had no chance of winning against one of  the greatest hunter species in history.
