# The Hunter-gatherer lifestyle
- The common impression that pre-agricultural humans lived	in an age	of stone is a misconception based on this archaeological bias. The Stone Age should more accurately be called the Wood Age because most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were made of wood.
- The hunter-gatherer way of life differed significantly from region to region and from season to season. Foragers seem to have enjoyed a more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds, laborers, and office clerks who followed in their footsteps.
