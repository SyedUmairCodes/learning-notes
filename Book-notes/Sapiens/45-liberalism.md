# Liberalism
- Liberal politics is based on the idea that the voters know best, and there is no need for Big Brother to tell us what is good for us.
- Liberal economics is based on the idea that the customer is always right.  Liberal art declares that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Students in liberal schools and universities are taught to think for themselves. 
- Commercials urge us to ‘Just do it!’ Action films, stage dramas, soap operas, novels, and catchy pop songs indoctrinate us constantly: ‘Be true to yourself, ‘Listen to yourself, ‘Follow your heart’.
