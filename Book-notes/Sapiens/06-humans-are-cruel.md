# Humans are cruel
- Humans are creul to other living things on this planet because we were not so powerful a few hunderd years ago and other giant animals were the lords of this planet.
- The quick and huge jump that we made in the natural foodchain thanks to our cognitive abilities was more like a hack for us rather a complete process becuase we didn't became accustomed to our newly found place in the foodchain. We were just given it by evolution and while we are now at the top our minds and bodies are still that of the lower level dewllers.
