# Currency of Evolution
- The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helix. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees.
- Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success story, but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever lived. The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal practices that only became crueler with the passing of the centuries.
