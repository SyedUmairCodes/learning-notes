# The root of all evil
- For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. 
- Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. 
- Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.
-  The first coins in history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia. These coins had a standardized weight of gold or silver, and were imprinted with an identification mark. The mark testified to two things. First, it indicated how much precious metal the coin contained. Second, it identified the authority that issued the coin and that guaranteed its contents. Almost all coins in use today are descendants of the Lydian coins.

> money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.
