### Authentic Cultures
- We still talk a lot about ‘authentic’ cultures, but if by authentic’ we mean something that developed independently, and that consists of ancient local traditions free of external influences, then there are no authentic cultures left on earth.
	-  Over the last few centuries, all cultures were changed almost beyond recognition by a flood of global influences.
### Views of the Theologians
- Theologians argued that Africans descend from Ham, son of Noah, saddled by his father with a curse that his offspring would be slaves.
	-  Biologists argued that blacks are less intelligent than whites and their moral sense less developed. Doctors alleged that blacks live in filth and spread diseases – in other words, they are a source of pollution.
- Most of the remaining tenth of the world’s human population was divided between four worlds of considerable size and complexity:
	- The Meso-american World, which encompassed most of Central America and parts of North America.
	- The Andean World, which encompassed most of western South America.
	- The Australian World, which encompassed the continent of Australia.
	- The Oceanic World, which encompassed most of the islands of the south-western Pacific Ocean, from Hawaii to New Zealand.

### The first pharaoh
- When the first pharaoh, Menes, united Egypt around 3000 BC, it was clear to the Egyptians that Egypt had a border, and beyond the border lurked ‘barbarians’. 
	- The barbarians were alien, threatening, and interesting only to the extent that they had land or natural resources that the Egyptians wanted. 
	- All the imagined orders people created tended to ignore a substantial part of humankind.

### A single truth
- Merchants, conquerors and prophets were the first people who managed to transcend the binary evolutionary division, ‘us vs them’, and to foresee the potential unity of humankind.
- For the merchants, the entire world was a single market and all humans were potential customers. 
	- They tried to establish an economic order that would apply to all, everywhere.
-  For the conquerors, the entire world was a single empire and all humans were potential subjects. 
- For the prophets, the entire world held a single truth and all humans were potential believers.
	-  They too tried to establish an order that would be applicable for everyone everywhere.
### The root of all evil
- For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. 
	- Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. 
	- Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. 
	- Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.
- The first coins in history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia. 
	- These coins had a standardized weight of gold or silver, and were imprinted with an identification mark.
		-  The mark testified to two things. First, it indicated how much precious metal the coin contained. Second, it identified the authority that issued the coin and that guaranteed its contents.
		-  Almost all coins in use today are descendants of the Lydian coins.

> money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.

### Religion
- Religion is the third aspect of history that has been successful in uniting mankind, the first and second being money and empires respectively.
	- The majority of ancient religions were local and exclusive. Their followers believed in local deities and spirits, and had no interest in converting the entire human race. 
	- As far as we know, universal and missionary religions began to appear only in the first millennium BC. 
	- Their emergence was one of the most important revolutions in history, and made a vital contribution to the unification of humankind, much like the emergence of universal empires and universal money.
### Animism
- Animists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other beings. 
	- They can all communicate directly through speech, song,	dance, and ceremony.
- Animism is not a specific religion. It is a generic name for thousands of very different religions, cults, and beliefs.
	-  What makes all of them ‘animist’ is this common approach to the world and man’s place in it.
- Most scholars agree that animistic beliefs were common among ancient foragers.
	-  Animism (from ‘anima’, ‘soul’	or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the belief that almost every place, every animal, every	plant, and every natural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate directly with humans.
- Animism continued to survive within polytheism, so polytheism continued to survive within monotheism. 
	- In theory, once a person believes that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, what’s the point in worshiping partial powers? 
	- Why would want to approach a lowly bureaucrat when the president’s office is open to you?
### Dualism
- Dualism believes that evil is an independent power, neither created by the good God, nor subordinate to it.
	-  Dualism explains that the entire universe is a battleground between these two forces, and that everything that happens in the world is part of the struggle.
### Monotheism
- Monotheistic religion bid farewell to the polytheism gods and then bought them back through the back door in the form of saints and babas and gurus.
	- In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. 
	- The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. 
	- Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from different sources. It’s called syncretism. 
	- Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.

### Chaotic system
- Chaotic systems come in two shapes.
	-  Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. 
	- The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. 
		- Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. 
	- Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system.
		- History is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system.
### Game theory
- Game theory explains how in multi-player systems, views and behavior patterns that harm _all_ players nevertheless manage to take root and spread. 
	- Arms races are a famous example.
	- This approach is sometimes called memetics. It assumes that, just as organic evolution is based on the replication of organic information units called ‘genes’, so cultural evolution is based on the replication of cultural information units called ‘memes’.
