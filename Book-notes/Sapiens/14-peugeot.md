# The story of Peugeot
- An icon that somewhat resembles the Stadel lion-man appears today on cars, trucks, and motorcycles from Paris to Sydney.  It’s the hood ornament that adorns vehicles made by Peugeot, one of the oldest and largest of Europe’s carmakers.
- Peugeot began as a small family business in the village of Valentigney, just 300 kilometres from the Stadel Cave. 
- Today, the company employs about 200,000 people worldwide, most of whom are strangers to each other. These strangers cooperate so effectively that in 2008 Peugeot produced more than 1.5 million automobiles, earning revenues of about 55 billion euros.
