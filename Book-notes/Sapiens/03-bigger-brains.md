# Bigger brains
- Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centi-meteres. The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic centi-meteres. Modern humans have a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centi-meteres. 
- In modern humans, the brain accounts for about 2–3 percent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 percent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest while an apes brain will require only 8 percent.
