# Homo soloensis and floresiensis
- On the island of Java, in Indonesia, There was a species of humans called Homo soloensis meaning ‘Man from the Solo Valley' and they were very well suited for tropical weather.
- In the small island of Flores, (also in indonesia) the humans  that lived there underwent a process of dwarfing. Humans first reached Flores when the sea level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from the mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were trapped on the island.
- Big people, who need a lot of food, died first. Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the generations, the people of Flores became dwarfs.  They were nevertheless able to produce stone tools and even managed occasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants – though, to be fair, the elephants were a dwarf species as well.
