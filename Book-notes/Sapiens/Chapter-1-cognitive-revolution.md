# Ancient history
- Chimpanzees are our closest relatives, Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. and one of them became the ancestor of all chimpanzees and  the other is our grandmother.
- Scientists put the same type of species that evolved from a common ancestor into groups called genus. Lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars are different species within the genus Panthera. they label the organisms with a two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Lions, for example, are called Panthera Leo, the species Leo of the genus Panthera.

# Homo soloensis
- On the island of Java, in Indonesia,There was a species of humans called Homo soloensis meaning ‘Man from the Solo Valley' and they were very well suited for tropical weather.
- On another island in Indonesia, the small island of Flores the humans underwent a process of dwarfing.Humans first reached Flores when the sea level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from the mainland.
	- When the seas rose again, some people were trapped on the island, which was poor in resources.
- Big people, who need a lot of food, died first. Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the generations, the people of Flores became dwarfs. 
	- This unique species, known by scientists as Homo floresiensis, reached a maximum height of only one meter and weighed no more than twenty-five kilograms. 
		- They were nevertheless able to produce stone tools and even managed occasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants – though, to be fair, the elephants were a dwarf species as well.
# Bigger brains
- Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centi-meteres. The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic centi-meteres. 
- Meanwhile, modern humans sport a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centi-meteres.
- Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 percent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 percent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. 
	- By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 percent of rest-time energy.
		- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging.
### Apes  Vs. Humans
- Another singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs. Standing up, it’s easier to scan the Savannah for game or enemies, and arms that are unnecessary for locomotion are freed for other purposes, like throwing stones or signaling. 
	- The more things these hands could do, the more successful their owners were, so evolutionary pressure brought about an increasing concentration of nerves and finely tuned muscles in the palms and fingers.
	- As a result, humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands. In particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools.
- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. 
	- These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position but in almost all day-to-day activities
### Natural selection
- Natural selection consequently favored earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. 
	- A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection, and education.
	- Most mammals emerge from the womb-like glazed earthenware emerging from a kiln – any attempt at remolding will scratch or break them. 
	- Humans emerge from the womb-like molten glass from a furnace. They can be spun, stretched, and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom.
		- Today we can educate our children to become Christian or Buddhist, capitalist or socialist, warlike or peace-loving.
### Banana republic
- Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana republic dictator. 
- Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the Savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. 
	- Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes have resulted from this over-hasty jump.
### More species of sapiens
- In 2010 another lost sibling was rescued from oblivion when scientists excavating the Denisova Cave in Siberia discovered a fossilized finger bone. 
- Genetic analysis proved that the finger belonged to a previously unknown human species, which was named Homo Denisova. 
	- Who knows how many lost relatives of ours are waiting to be discovered in other caves, on other islands, and in other climes.
- Two million years ago, genetic mutations resulted in the appearance of a new human species called Homo erectus. 
	- Its emergence was accompanied by the development of a new stone tool technology, now recognized as a defining feature of this species. 
	- As long as Homo erectus did not undergo further genetic alterations, its stone tools remained roughly the same – for close to 2 million years!
- While these humans were evolving in Europe and Asia, evolution in East Africa did not stop. 
- The cradle of humanity continued to nurture numerous new species, such as Homo rudolfensis, ‘Man from Lake Rudolf’, Homo ergaster, ‘Working Man’, and eventually our species, which we’ve immodestly named Homo sapiens, ‘Wise Man’.
### Sapiens conquer fire
- A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. Some human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years ago.
	- By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals, and the forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire daily.
	-  Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterward, humans may even have started deliberately torching their neighborhoods
	- When humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force.
	- Unlike eagles, humans could choose when and where to ignite a flame, and they were able to exploit fire for any number of tasks. 
		- Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure, or strength of the human body.
	- But the best thing fire did was cook. 
		- Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms – such as wheat, rice, and potatoes – became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. 
		- Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, but it also changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. 
		- Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favorites such as fruits, nuts, insects, and carrion if they were cooked.
### Ancient Racism
- Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small difference in skin color, dialect, or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group.
	-  Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards an entirely different human species? 
	- It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.
### Reaching Australia
- Within a remarkably short period, Sapiens reached Europe and East Asia.
About 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea and landed in Australia – a
continent hitherto untouched by humans.
- Were the Australian extinction an isolated event, we could grant humans the benefit of the doubt.
	-  But the historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial killer.
### Theories on genetic mutation
- The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language.
- We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.
-  Why did it occur in Sapien's DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell.
- We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. 
	- We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world.
- A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means of sharing information about the world. 
	- But the most important information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison. 
	- Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory, Homo sapiens is a primarily social animal.
- Social cooperation is our key to survival and reproduction. 
	- It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. 
	- It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.
### Languages and relationships
- The amount of information that one must obtain and store to track the ever-changing relationships of a few dozen individuals is staggering.
	-  In a band of fifty individuals, there are 1,225 one-on-one relationships and countless more complex social combinations.
- Many animals and human species could previously say, ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe.’ 
	- This ability to speak about fiction is the most unique feature of the Sapiens language.
- Legends, myths, gods,  and religions appeared for the first time with the cognitive Revolution. 
- Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers.
	- That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
### The story of Peugeot
- An icon that somewhat resembles the Stadel lion-man appears today on cars, trucks, and motorcycles from Paris to Sydney. 
	- It’s the hood ornament that adorns vehicles made by Peugeot, one of the oldest and largest of Europe’s carmakers.
- Peugeot began as a small family business in the village of Valentigney, just 300 kilometres from the Stadel Cave. 
	- Today the company employs about 200,000 people worldwide, most of whom are strangers to each other. These strangers cooperate so effectively that in 2008 Peugeot produced more than 1.5 million automobiles, earning revenues of about 55 billion euros.
### Ever changing behavior
- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution Homo sapiens has been able to revise their behavior rapidly following changing needs.
	- This opened a fast lane of cultural evolution, bypassing the traffic jams of genetic evolution. Speeding down this fast lane, Homo sapiens soon far outstripped all other human and animal species in their ability to cooperate.
- Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. 
	- On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees, and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations, and corporations.
### Neanderthals Vs Sapiens
- Archaeologists have discovered sites where entire herds were butchered annually in such ways. 
	- There are even sites where fences and obstacles were erected to create artificial traps and slaughtering grounds
- Fifty Neanderthals cooperating in traditional and static patterns were no match for 500 versatile and innovative Sapiens. 
	- Even if the Sapiens lost the first round, they could quickly invent new stratagems that would enable them to win the next time.
### Hunter-gatherer
- The common impression that pre-agricultural humans lived	in an age	of stone is a misconception based on this archaeological bias.
	-  The Stone Age should more accurately be called the Wood Age because most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were made of wood.
- The hunter-gatherer way of life differed significantly from region to region and from season to season.
	- Foragers seem to have enjoyed a more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds, laborers, and office clerks who followed in their footsteps.
### Ubiquity
- We hardly notice how ubiquitous our stuff is until we have to move it to a new house.
	- Foragers	moved house every month, every week,	and sometimes even every day, toting whatever they	had on their backs.
	- There were no moving companies, wagons, or even pack animals to share the burden. They consequently had to make do with only the most essential possessions.
### Natural way of life
- The heated debates about Homo sapiens’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point.
	-  Ever since	the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural	way	of life for Sapiens. 
	- There	are	only	cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities.
- Thanks to the appearance of fiction, even people with the same genetic make-up who lived under similar ecological conditions were able to create very different imagined realities, which manifested themselves in different norms and values.
### Foragers
- The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their	varied diet. 
	- Farmers tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet.
- Ancient foragers also suffered less	from infectious diseases.
	- Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles, and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural Revolution.
- Modern foragers occasionally abandon and even	kill old or disabled people who cannot keep up with the band. 
	- Unwanted babies and children may be slain, and there are even cases of religiously inspired human sacrifice.
### Noah's Ark
- The sea barrier prevented not just humans but also many other Afro-Asian animals and plants from reaching this ‘Outer World’. 
	- As a result, the organisms of distant lands like Australia and Madagascar evolved in isolation for millions upon millions of years, taking on shapes and natures very different from those of their distant Afro-Asian relatives.
- The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages.
	- If diprotodons had been the only large animal to disappear at this time, it might have been just a fluke. 
	- But more than 90 per cent of Australia’s mega-fauna disappeared along with the diprotodon.
- If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to oblivion. 
	- Among all the world’s large creatures, the only survivors of the human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as galley slaves in Noah’s Ark.
## End of the Cognitive revolution
- The Cognitive Revolution is accordingly the point when history declared its independence from biology.
	- We are still animals, and our physical, emotional, and cognitive abilities are still shaped by our DNA.
	-  Our societies are built from the same building blocks as Neanderthal or chimpanzee societies. 
	- The more we examine these building blocks – sensations, emotions, family ties – the less difference we find between us and other apes.
