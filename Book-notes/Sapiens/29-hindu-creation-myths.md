# Hindu creation myths
- Hindu creation myth, the gods fashioned the world out of the body of a primeval being, the Purusa.
-  The sun was created from the Purusa’s eye, the moon from the Purusa’s brain, the Brahmins (priests) from its mouth, the Kshatriyas (warriors) from its arms, the Vaishyas (peasants and merchants) from its thighs, and the Shudras (servants) from its legs.

> Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it.
