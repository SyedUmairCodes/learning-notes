# Religion
- Religion is the third aspect of history that has been successful in uniting mankind, the first and second being money and empires respectively.
- The majority of ancient religions were local and exclusive. Their followers believed in local deities and spirits, and had no interest in converting the entire human race. As far as we know, universal and missionary religions began to appear only in the first millennium BC. 
- Their emergence was one of the most important revolutions in history, and made a vital contribution to the unification of humankind, much like the emergence of universal empires and universal money.
## Animism
- Animists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other beings. They can all communicate directly through speech, song,	dance, and ceremony.
- Animism is not a specific religion. It is a generic name for thousands of very different religions, cults, and beliefs. What makes all of them ‘animist’ is this common approach to the world and man’s place in it.
- Most scholars agree that animistic beliefs were common among ancient foragers. Animism (from ‘anima’, ‘soul’	or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the belief that almost every place, every animal, every	plant, and every natural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate directly with humans.
- Animism continued to survive within polytheism, so polytheism continued to survive within monotheism. In theory, once a person believes that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, what’s the point in worshiping partial powers? Why would want to approach a lowly bureaucrat when the president’s office is open to you?
## Dualism
- Dualism believes that evil is an independent power, neither created by the good God, nor subordinate to it. Dualism explains that the entire universe is a battleground between these two forces, and that everything that happens in the world is part of the struggle.
## Monotheism
- Monotheistic religion bid farewell to the polytheism gods and then bought them back through the back door in the form of saints and babas and gurus.
- In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. 
- The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. 
- Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from different sources. It’s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.
