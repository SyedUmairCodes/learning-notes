>[!title:Part-2: Agricultural revolution]
### Agriculture starts
- The transition to agriculture began around 9500–8500 BC in the hill country of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Levant. 
	- It began slowly and in a restricted geographical area. Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 9000 BC; peas and lentils around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC. 
	- Some animals and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication was over.
- Scholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great leap forward for humanity. They told a tale of progress fueled by human brain power. Evolution gradually produced ever more intelligent people. 
	- Eventually, people were so smart that they were able to decipher nature’s secrets, enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheat.
	-  As soon as this happened, they cheerfully abandoned the grueling, dangerous, and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.
### The average farmer
- The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return.
	-  The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.
- The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets.
	-  Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price.
### Revolution can cause problems
- Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. 
	- Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields.
### Currency of Evolution
- The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helix.
	- Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees.
- Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success story, but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever lived.
	-  The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal practices that only became crueler with the passing of the centuries.
### Hammurabi's code
- It is easy to accept that Hammurabi’s Code was a myth, but we do not want to hear that human rights are also a myth.
	-  If people realize that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse?
- Slavery is not a human invention. 
	- Hammurabi saw it as ordained by the gods.
	-  Aristotle argued that slaves have a ‘slavish nature’ whereas free people have a ‘free nature’. Their status in society is merely a reflection of their innate nature.
### Sumerian numeral system
- The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral systems.
	- Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.
### Hindu creation myths
- Hindu creation myth, the gods fashioned the world out of the body of a primeval being, the Purusa.
	-  The sun was created from the Purusa’s eye, the moon from the Purusa’s brain, the Brahmins (priests) from its mouth, the Kshatriyas (warriors) from its arms, the Vaishyas (peasants and merchants) from its thighs, and the Shudras (servants) from its legs.
