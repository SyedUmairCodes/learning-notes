# Hammurabi's code
- It is easy to accept that Hammurabi’s Code was a myth, but we do not want to hear that human rights are also a myth.
- If people realize that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse? 
- Slavery is not a human invention.  Hammurabi saw it as ordained by the gods.
- Aristotle argued that slaves have a ‘slavish nature’ whereas free people have a ‘free nature’. Their status in society is merely a reflection of their innate nature.
