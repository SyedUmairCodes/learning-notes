# Humans conquer fire
- A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. Some human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years ago.
- By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals, and the forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire daily. Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterward, humans may even have started deliberately torching their neighborhoods
- When humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force. Unlike other animals, humans could choose when and where to ignite a flame, and they were able to exploit fire for any number of tasks. Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure, or strength of the human body.
- But the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms – such as wheat, rice, and potatoes – became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. 
- Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, but it also changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food.  Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favorites such as fruits, nuts, insects, and carrion if they were cooked.
