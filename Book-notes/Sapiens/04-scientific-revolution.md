### Start of the Scientific revolution
- Around AD 1500, history made its most momentous choice, changing not only the fate of humankind, but arguably the fate of all life on earth. 
	- We call it the Scientific Revolution. It began in western Europe, a large peninsula on the western tip of Afro-Asia
### Power to end it all
- The single most remarkable and defining moment of the past 500 years came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. 
	- At that precise second, American scientists detonated the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it.
### Ignorance 
- Homo sapiens have the willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything.
	- Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.
### Modern science
- The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge.
	- It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories.
### New powers
- The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating theories.
	- It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.
### Frankenstein prophecy
- The Frankenstein myth confronts Homo sapiens with the fact that the last days are fast approaching.
	- Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, so goes the story, the pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques, but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds.
### Buddhist philosphy
- According to Buddhism, most people identify happiness with pleasant feelings, while identifying suffering with unpleasant feelings.
	-  People consequently ascribe immense importance to what they feel, craving to experience more and more pleasures, while avoiding pain. Whatever we do throughout our lives, whether scratching our leg, fidgeting slightly in the chair, or fighting world wars, we are just trying to get pleasant feelings.
- The problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more than fleeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If five minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel sad and dejected.
	-  So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles.

> suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving


### Liberalism
- Liberal politics is based on the idea that the voters know best, and there is no need for Big Brother to tell us what is good for us.
	-  Liberal economics is based on the idea that the customer is always right. 
	- Liberal art declares that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
	- Students in liberal schools and universities are taught to think for themselves.
	- Commercials urge us to ‘Just do it!’ Action films, stage dramas, soap operas, novels, and catchy pop songs indoctrinate us constantly: ‘Be true to yourself, ‘Listen to yourself, ‘Follow your heart’.
### Personal narratives
- Synchronizing one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. 
	- As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction.
### Happiness
- If happiness is based on feeling pleasant sensations, then in order to be happier we need to re-engineer our biochemical system. 
	- If happiness is based on feeling that life is meaningful, then in order to be happier we need to delude ourselves more effectively. Is there a third alternative?
