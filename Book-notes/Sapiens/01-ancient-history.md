# Ancient history
- Chimpanzees are our closest relatives, Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. and one of them became the ancestor of all chimpanzees and  the other is our grandmother.
- Scientists put the same type of species that evolved from a common ancestor into groups called genus. Lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars are different species within the genus Panthera. they label the organisms with a two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Lions, for example, are called Panthera Leo, the species Leo of the genus Panthera.
