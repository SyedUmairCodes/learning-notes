# Ubiquity
- We hardly notice how ubiquitous our stuff is until we have to move it to a new house. Foragers	moved house every month, every week,	and sometimes even every day, toting whatever they	had on their backs.
- There were no moving companies, wagons, or even pack animals to share the burden. They consequently had to make do with only the most essential possessions.
