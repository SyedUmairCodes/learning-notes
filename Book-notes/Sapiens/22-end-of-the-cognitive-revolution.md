# End of the Cognitive revolution
- The Cognitive Revolution eneded when history declared its independence from biology.
- We are still animals, and our physical, emotional, and cognitive abilities are still shaped by our DNA.
- Our societies are built from the same building blocks as Neanderthal or chimpanzee societies. The more we examine these building blocks – sensations, emotions, family ties – the less difference we find between us and other apes.
