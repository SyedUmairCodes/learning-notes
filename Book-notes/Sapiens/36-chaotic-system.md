# Chaotic system
- Chaotic systems come in two shapes.
- Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system.  Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. 
- Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. History is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system.
