# Noah's Ark
- The sea barrier prevented not just humans but also many other Afro-Asian animals and plants from reaching the "Outer World". As a result, the organisms of distant lands like Australia and Madagascar evolved in isolation for millions upon millions of years, taking on shapes and natures very different from those of their distant Afro-Asian relatives.
- The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages. If diprotodons had been the only large animal to disappear at this time, it might have been just a fluke.  But more than 90 per cent of Australia’s mega-fauna disappeared along with the diprotodon.
- If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to oblivion.   Among all the world’s large creatures, the only survivors of the human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as galley slaves in Noah’s Ark
