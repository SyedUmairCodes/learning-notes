# More humans
- In 2010, another lost species of humans was rescued from oblivion when scientists excavating the Denisova Cave in Siberia discovered a fossilized finger bone.  Genetic analysis proved that the finger belonged to a previously unknown human species, which was named Homo Denisova. 
- Two million years ago, genetic mutations resulted in the appearance of a new human species called Homo erectus.  The cradle of humanity continued to nurture numerous new species, such as Homo rudolfensis, ‘Man from Lake Rudolf’, Homo ergaster, ‘Working Man’, and eventually our species, which we’ve immodestly named Homo sapiens, ‘Wise Man’.
