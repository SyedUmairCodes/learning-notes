# Humans Vs Other mammals
- Natural selection consequently favors those who are born earleir. Humans are born in a period of nine-months and even after that our most vital functions are not developed and can take upto 5 years to be fully developed.
- Other mammals like cats and horses also give birth the same way humans do but since they don't require any more time to develop after birth they can start living their lives on their own after 1-2 weeks.
- Another thing that seperates humans from other mammals is that a cat will always be a cat and not a dog. While a human can be whatever he chooses to be when he grows up.
