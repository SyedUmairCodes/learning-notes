# The average farmer
- The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was historyâ€™s biggest fraud.
- The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. As a result human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price.
