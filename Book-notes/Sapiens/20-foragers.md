# Foragers
- The foragersâ€™ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet. Ancient foragers also suffered less	from infectious diseases.
- Modern humans tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet. Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles, and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural Revolution.
- Modern foragers occasionally abandon and even	kill old or disabled people who cannot keep up with the band. Unwanted babies and children may be slain, and there are even cases of religiously inspired human sacrifice.
