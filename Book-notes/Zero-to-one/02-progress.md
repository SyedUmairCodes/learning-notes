# Progress
- Progress, is of two types. There is horizontal progress or vertical progress. 
- Horizontal progress means copying something and mass producing it because it has already proven to be useful.
- Vertical progress means creating new things and is a lot harder than horizontal progress because it hasn't been proved yet that it would be useful or not.
