# The future
- In the most minimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. The thing that makes the future so exciting is that we don't know what will happen in it and the possiblities are endless and each decision can change the outcome of the future.
- In this sense, if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100 years away. If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is nearly at hand. it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world.
