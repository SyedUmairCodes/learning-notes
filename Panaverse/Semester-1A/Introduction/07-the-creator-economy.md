# The creator economy
In the past only the big corporations could create products and sell them because the tools that could enable smaller creators create them didn't exist or were to expensive.

Amazon and Pixar are examples of pioneers in the creator economy because Pixar was the one of the first companies that made computer 	based 3d animations and Amazon was the first companies to introduce e-commerce.

Then, more and more startups and companies begin to create and launch products that helped engineers create products and launch them. MongoDB, DirectX, and Stripe are examples of these types of companies.

Finally, today anyone can create anything that they like and sell it to the people, Creators are free from any type of restraints and they can let their imaginations run wild. Shopify, Roblox, Notion, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch are examples of the companies that are leading the creator era revolution.

This revolution is what gave birth to Web 3.0 and the meta-verse. An economy where everyone can earn irrespective to what skills they have.
