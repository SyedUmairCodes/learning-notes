# The standards and terminologies of the meta-verse
Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Unity, Sony, and 30 other companies are putting their differences aside and are working together to create inter-operable infrastructure for the meta-verse.

The Meta-verse Standards Forum will strive to make all of the meta-verses inter-operable and offer cross-compatibility. The main goals of the forum are making the development and adoption of the meta-verse easier and develop consistent terminology and guidelines. One major goal of the forum is to prevent a single entity or corporation to have monopoly over the meta-verse.

Industry leaders on the other hand want the meta-verse to be built on open-source standards.
