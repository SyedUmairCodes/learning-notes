# Meta-verse and Money
The meta-verse is the next generation of the internet and is potentially a $13 trillion opportunity. In simple terms the meta-verse will be the bridge between the digital and the real world.

There would be no central-bank in the meta-verse instead all of the transaction will happen in the form of crypto-currencies, tokens, and NFTs. It will be dominated by the creator economy where any one can create a digital good and sell it.
