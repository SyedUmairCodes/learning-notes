# How the Meta-verse will change everything
The meta-verse is a very big deal. It will revolutionize every industry and enterprise that we know as of now. These are just some examples how the meta-verse will change industries:

## Customer support
Imagine, your phone or computer stopped working or your car won't start. You will need to go to the mechanic or the customer support center but in the meta-verse whenever you need support with something just login to your meta-verse avatar and your mechanic or the customer support representative will quickly guide you how to fix your problem in real-time without you going anywhere.

## Sales and Marketing
The meta-verse will be fueled by the creator-economy and you can purchase your groceries from your home or office and it will be delivered to your doorstep.

But this will also introduce ads that will pop-up right in your face as soon as advertisement agencies start introducing ads in the meta-verse.

## Social gatherings
Concerts or social gatherings will only happen in the meta-verse since anyone can join in on the fun from anywhere. This new way of having social gatherings will be more effective than the real-life concerts that we have.

## Architecture
Architecture and civil engineering sector will benefit a lot from the meta-verse as it will provide real-time virtual simulations of how a sky-scrapper or a airplane should be built and the engineers can zoom in or out from the virtual hologram which will help in finding out flaws that the naked human eye cannot see.

## Workforce training and scenarios
The meta-verse will make the training of police officers and teaching employees of a corporation evacuate the building in the case of an emergency or fire more quick and effective.

You can virtually create any type of scenario that we can imagine and finding an effective solution to that scenario will be easier, quicker, and more cost-effective.
