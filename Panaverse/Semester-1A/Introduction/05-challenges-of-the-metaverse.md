# Challenges of the Meta-verse
The meta-verse as termed by the oxford dictionary is termed as:

> A virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users

While the meta-verse is a great opportunity for everyone there are still some things that are challenging for those that want to use the meta-verse or develop technologies for the meta=verse:

## Reputation & Identity
Reputation and identity is a big challenge for those working in the meta-verse space. In the real world you can identify a person using their identity card but in the meta-verse everyone will use a computer generated "avatar" which you can customize in any way or form that you like. You could be have blonde hair in real life and your avatar could look like Elon Musk, Which makes scamming people really easy.

Anyone can look like anyone, The other person you're talking to in the meta-verse could be a bot and you wouldn't be able to tell. We need a system that can verify you and your meta-verse avatar so that your identity is not stolen.

## Data & Security
Even if the meta-verse is built using open-source technologies we will still need new laws for how big companies can handle and use our personal data because you'll still need a Facebook or a Microsoft account to sign-in into your virtual avatar in the meta-verse. 

Since the meta-verse is a new and ever-expanding technology we will need to keep up with it's progress and build new methods of keeping the personal data of users secure and ensure the privacy of users.

## Currency & Payments
The meta-verse will have it's own currency which will be based on crypto-currencies and NFTs. The challenge will lie in convincing users that they can rely on and most important feel safe while engaging in any trade within the meta-verse.

## Laws & Jurisdiction
The meta-verse is a virtual-space that brings people that share a common interest from all-around the world together. But since any one can share any thing they want there aren't any laws about safe and unsafe content being available in the meta-verse and being accessible by minors or content that is not safe-for-work cannot be hidden at public or office spaces.

Content regulation is one of the greatest challenges of the meta-verse.

## Time and Space
If the virtual reality technology takes a huge leap in advancement and we live in an era where the physical and virtual world are almost united and people start spending more time in the meta-verse than they do in real life then what will happen to the human needs like eating, going to the toilet, and sleeping?

We won't be aware of our surrondings and time in the real-world once we enter the virtual realm and this problem is the only thing that's keeping the meta-verse from taking over.
