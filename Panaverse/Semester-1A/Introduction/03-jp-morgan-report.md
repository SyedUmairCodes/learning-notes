# JP Morgan: Opportunities in the Meta-verse
The meta-verse is a seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives, creating a unified, virtual community where we can work, play, relax, transact and socialize.

The core concept of the meta-verse has been around since 20 years, Multiplayer games like Clash of Clans and The sims are examples of what the meta-verse is actually like.

Now, with the advancement of technology the same mechanics of those games can be applied to our real lives and we can play the live action version of The Sims.

Block-chains and NFTs are the backbone technologies of the meta-verse, they allow transactions of digital goods in the meta-verse.
You can sell your digital paintings at an online art-gallery and all of the critics can appreciate your work from the comfort of their houses, If they like a piece they can purchase it in the form of an non-fungible token or NFT. 

> The meta-verse is surely going to change every single industry that we know of.
